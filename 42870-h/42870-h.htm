<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Keith family were relatives of Horace
Dinsmore, and as my readers will observe, the
date of this story is some seven years earlier
than that of the first Elsie book.</p>

<p>The journey, and that most <i>sickly</i> season,
which I have attempted to describe, were
events in my own early childhood. The latter
still dwells in my memory as a dreadful dream.</p>

<p>Our family&mdash;a large one&mdash;were all down
with the fever except my aged grandmother
and a little sister of six or seven, and "help
could not be had for love or money."</p>

<p>My father, who was a physician, kept up
and made his rounds among his town and
country patients for days after the fever had
attacked him, but was at length compelled to
take his bed, and I well remember lying there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
beside him while the neighbors flocked into the
room to consult him about their sick ones at
home.</p>

<p>That region of country is now, I believe, as
healthy as almost any other part of our favored
land. Such a season, it was said, had never
been known before, and there has been none
like it since.</p>

<h2>Chapter First.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Weep not that the world changes&mdash;did it keep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A stable, changeless course, 'twere cause to weep."</span><br />

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A spring</span> morning in 183-; winter's icy
breath exchanged for gentle breezes; a faint
tinge of yellow green on the woods but now so
brown and bare; violets and anemones showing
their pretty modest faces by the roadside;
hill and valley clothed with verdure, rivulets
dancing and singing, the river rolling onward
in majestic gladness; apple, peach and cherry
trees in bloom; birds building their nests;
men and women busied here and there in field
or garden, and over all</p>

<div class='center'>
"The uncertain glory of an April day."<br />
</div>

<p>The sun now shining out warm and bright
from a cloudless sky, now veiling his face while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
a sudden shower of rain sends the busy workers
hurrying to the nearest shelter.</p>

<p>The air is full of pleasant rural sounds&mdash;the
chirp of insects, the twittering of birds, the
crowing of cocks&mdash;now near at hand, now far
away, mellowed by the distance; and in the
streets of the pretty village of Lansdale, down
yonder in the valley, there is the cheerful hum
of busy life; of buying and selling, of tearing
down and building up; neighbors chatting on
doorsteps or over the garden fence, boys whistling
and hallooing to their mates, children conning
their tasks, and mothers crooning to their
babes.</p>

<p>Out of the side door of a substantial brick
house standing far back from the street, in the
midst of a garden where the grass is of a velvety
green spangled with violets, and snowballs
and lilacs are bursting into bloom, steps a slight
girlish figure.</p>

<p>The face half hidden under a broad brimmed
garden hat, is not regularly beautiful, but
there is a great deal of character in it; the
mouth is both firm and sweet, the lips are full
and red, the eyes are large, dark and lustrous,
and the complexion rich with the hues of
health.</p>

<p>She sends a quick glance from side to side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
clasps her hands together with a gesture as of
sudden pain, paces rapidly to and fro for a
moment, seemingly striving after self-control,
then turning into a path that leads across the garden
to the hedge that separates it from another,
hastens down it, opens the gate and passing
through looks about as if in search of some one.</p>

<p>But there is no one there, and the girl
trips gracefully onward to the house, a pretty
cottage with vine-covered porches.</p>

<p>The parlor windows were open and within
a little lady of middle age, quaintly attired in
a chintz gown very short and scant, and made
after a pattern peculiarly her own, was busied
with brush and duster.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the young girl as she
stepped upon the porch, she called to her in a
remarkably sweet-toned voice,</p>

<p>"In here, dearie! Just step through the
window. I'm glad to see you." The windows
opening to the floor, it was an easy matter to
obey, and the girl did so; then stood silent,
her lips quivering, her eyes full.</p>

<p>"My child, what is it?" cried the older
lady, dropping her duster to take the girl's
hand and draw her to a seat upon the sofa, "is&mdash;is
any one ill?"</p>

<p>"No, no; not that, Aunt Wealthy!" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the girl swallowed down her tears and spoke
with a determined effort to be calm. "But
something has happened and mother delegated
me to bring you the news.</p>

<p>"You know father has been talking for
some time of leaving Lansdale, and this morning,
at breakfast, he told us&mdash;us children, I
mean&mdash;he and mother had talked it over last
night, and I don't believe she slept much for
thinking of it&mdash;that he had fully made up his
mind to move out to Indiana. And we're to
go just as soon as we can get ready.</p>

<p>"There, now you know it all!" finishing
with a burst of tears in spite of herself.</p>

<p>For a moment her listener was dumb with
surprise; but it was not in Wealthy Stanhope's
nature to witness distress without an
effort to comfort and relieve.</p>

<p>To lose the society of this family who were
her nearest and dearest relatives, would be a
great grief to her. The mother, Marcia Keith,
the orphan child of a sister, committed to her
care in early infancy and trained up by her to
a lovely and useful womanhood, was as a
daughter to her&mdash;her boys and girls as grandchildren
to be loved and petted and rejoiced
over after the custom of fond grandparents
What a lonely old age for her without them!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>That was her first thought, the next how to
assuage the sorrow of the weeping girl at her
side.</p>

<p>"There, there, Mildred, dear," she said,
softly stroking and patting the hand she held,
"perhaps you will find it not so bad after all,
there must be a bright side to the picture that
we shall discover if we look for it determinately.
There will be new scenes, perhaps some adventures
on the journey."</p>

<p>"Yes, auntie, very likely; and I've often
wished I could have some adventures!" Mildred
answered, dashing away her tears with a
rather hysterical little laugh.</p>

<p>"You're not going to school to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, auntie, no more school for me: that's
the hard part of it, for I do so want a good
education."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you shall have books, and
your father and mother&mdash;both educated people&mdash;will
help you; and who knows but you may
in the end distance your mates here? The
knowledge we gain by our own efforts, out of
school, is often the most serviceable."</p>

<p>The girl's face brightened.</p>

<p>"If I don't turn out something worth while
it shall not be for want of trying," she said,
her cheek flushing, her eyes sparkling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Then starting up. "I must hurry home;
for mother and I are going to work with might
and main at the spring sewing; and then at
the tearing up and packing. Aunt Wealthy,
I'm glad I'm old enough to be a help; there
are so many younger ones, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, Milly, and you are a great help and
comfort to your mother."</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if I could only learn her patience;
but the children are dreadfully trying&mdash;with
their untidy ways, their mischief and noise.
They nearly distract me at times and before I
know it I've given somebody a shake or a slap,
or if not that, a very uncomplimentary piece
of my mind," she added half laughing, half
sighing.</p>

<p>Then with a hasty good-bye she tripped
away, her aunt calling after her, "Tell your
mother I'll be in after a while."</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope sat where the girl had left
her, the usually busy hands folded in her lap
her gaze fixed meditatively on the carpet.
Presently she lifted her head with a deep
drawn sigh, her eye passed slowly about the
room resting lovingly now upon this familiar
object, now upon that.</p>

<p>"I don't think they would sell for much,"
she said, musingly: "the carpet has been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
wear for thirty odd years and the colors have
faded a good deal: the chairs and tables are
older still and so are the pictures on the walls,
that sampler my grandmother worked when
she was a young girl&mdash;which was many years
ago; and these chair-cushions too"&mdash;rising and
going from one to another, giving to each in
turn a little loving shake and pat&mdash;"she embroidered
and filled with her own feathers;
and so I value them more than their weight in
gold. Marcia, I think, values them also, but&mdash;to
a stranger, I suppose they would all seem
old, dingy and worthless, though to me they
are real treasures. I've a sincere affection for
them.</p>

<p>"But what is that to my love for Marcia
and her children! what indeed!"</p>

<p>She hastily picked up duster and brush,
gave a finishing touch here and there, drew
down the blinds and left the room.</p>

<p>A few moments later she might have been
seen in bonnet and shawl and armed with a
large cotton umbrella, issuing from her front
gate and walking briskly toward the business
part of the town.</p>

<p>It was nearly two hours before she returned,
with a step a trifle less brisk, and arms
filled with brown paper parcels.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>She passed her own gate and stopped at
Mr. Keith's.</p>

<p>Mildred ran to open it.</p>

<p>"Why, auntie, how you are loaded! Give
me your bundles."</p>

<p>"Yes, child, carry them in to your mother.
I've been to every store in town; such beautiful
remnants! couldn't help buying! make up
pretty for the children; afraid there's none big
enough for you, dear. Am all out of breath
with walking."</p>

<p>"Yes; it's too bad; don't say anything
more till you've rested," said the girl, leading
the way into the pleasant family room, hastily
laying the packages on the table, and drawing
forward a large cushioned rocking chair.</p>

<p>"There, sit down, auntie, and let me take
your things."</p>

<p>"Aunt Wealthy! come at last! we've been
wondering what kept you," said a handsome,
matronly, but still youthful looking lady, with
a babe in her arms, coming in at that moment.
"And you've been out shopping? I hope you
were not caught in any of the showers?"</p>

<p>"No; I managed to dodge them; sandwiching
my walks in between. So you're
going to leave Lansdale, Marcia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, auntie; and you; that's the worst of it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The cheery voice faltered over the last
words, and the bright eyes grew dim.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, Marcia; who says that I'm to
be left behind?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Wealthy! do you mean it? is it
possible you could think of such a sacrifice?"
cried Mrs. Keith, starting up and nearly dropping
her babe in her intense, joyful surprise.</p>

<p>"As what?" queried the aunt between a
smile and a tear. "Marcia, I can't give up my
home, as you very well know; but I have
found a tenant for it (the minister and his wife
who are perfectly delighted to get it; for it's
their only chance for going to housekeeping;
and they'll be sure to take good care of my
furniture and other belongings), and rented it
just as it stands, for a year; and I'm going
with you to Hoosier land.</p>

<p>"It'll be quite an importation of Buckeyes,
won't it? All coming in one lot."</p>

<p>And the good affectionate old soul finished
with a laugh, jumped up from her chair and
stretching out her arms to three little ones who
had come running in while she was speaking,
caught them to her bosom, kissed and cried
over them, asking, "Are you glad, Cyril?
are you glad, Don? and Fan, too? are you
glad that auntie is going with you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a chorus of shouts of delight;
there were huggings and kissings, asking and
answering of questions; and then things quieted
down a little and the children went back to
their play, Cyril remarking, as he shut the door,</p>

<p>"Now I shan't cry when we go; 'cause all
my friends and colations is goin' along."</p>

<p>"Now to business," said Aunt Wealthy attacking
the parcels. "I'm going to help you,
Marcia, in getting your tribe ready for their
exodus out of this land of plenty into that
western wilderness. Here are two or three
dress patterns apiece for the little girls. These
stuff ones are for them to travel in, and I think
they had better be made long necked and high
sleeved. Don't you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith looked up with a slightly puzzled
expression; then a light breaking over her
face, for she was used to her aunt's transpositions&mdash;"I
don't know," she answered dubiously,
"wouldn't it make them look a little
old-womanish? Low necks and short sleeves
are prettier for children, I think; and they're
used to it. Summer's coming on, too, and we
must expect warm weather."</p>

<p>"What route shall you take?"</p>

<p>"Up the Ohio and Erie Canal and round
Michigan by the lakes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be cool on the water."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true; and I'll take your advice."</p>

<p>"That's right; they'll be less likely to
catch cold from any little exposure, and their
necks and arms will be protected from the
sun. Now, if you'll tear off a skirt, I'll get to
work. I brought thimble and scissors along."</p>

<p>Those were not the days of sewing machines,
and though garments were made in
much simpler style then than now, the sewing
for such a family as the Keiths was no small
task.</p>

<p>It would take some weeks of very diligent
work by three or four pairs of hands to accomplish
what the mother deemed necessary in the
way of preparing their wardrobe for the contemplated
journey.</p>

<p>Under the instruction of her mother and
aunt, Mildred had already become as accomplished
a needlewoman as either of them. A
seamstress had been engaged to assist but could
not be had for a few days; so plans and prospects
could be talked over freely as the three
sat and worked together, Baby Annis asleep
in her cradle or playing contentedly on the
carpet at her mother's feet.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Second.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"The mother, in her office, holds the key<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of the soul; and she it is who stamps the coin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of character, and makes the being who would be a savage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But for her gentle cares, a Christian man."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old Play.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> striking of the town clock, the ringing
of bells, the blowing of whistles and "the
schoolboy's glad shout" announced the noontide
hour.</p>

<p>A sound of coming footsteps, of gay, young
voices, an opening of doors, letting in fresh
breezes from without, and with them two
bright, blooming, merry little girls and a lad
between them and Mildred in age, in whose
great black eyes lurked a world of fun and
mischief.</p>

<p>"Softly, softly, children!" the mother said
looking up with a smile as they came dancing
and prancing in. "Rupert, are you not old
enough to begin to act in a rather more gentlemanly
way?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I beg your pardon. Yours
too, Aunt Wealthy, I didn't know till this
moment that you were here."</p>

<p>"Mother, he's always teasing," complained
the younger of the girls, "he says we'll have
to live in wigwams like the Indians and perhaps
grow to be as black and ugly as they are."</p>

<p>"But they're not black, Ada," exclaimed
the other, "my g'ography calls 'em red men."</p>

<p>"Well, that's 'most worse, I'd as lief be
black as red."</p>

<p>"If you're careful to wear your sunbonnets
when you go out, you won't grow to be either,"
remarked Mildred, while Mrs. Keith said with
a look of mild reproof,</p>

<p>"Rupert, my son, was it quite truthful to
tell your sisters such things?"</p>

<p>"I was only making fun," he answered,
trying to turn it off with a laugh, but blushing
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Innocent fun I never object to, but sport
is too dearly bought at the sacrifice of truth.</p>

<p>"My boy," she added with energy, "one
should go to the stake rather than tell a falsehood;
though it were no more than to say that
two and two do not make four."</p>

<p>"Mother, I believe you would!" he said,
gazing with loving admiration into her earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
face. "I've never known you to swerve a
hair's breadth from the truth in any way," and
coming close to her side and speaking almost
in a whisper, "I mean to try to be worthy of
you in the future."</p>

<p>She looked at him with glistening eyes,
and dropping her work took his hands in hers
for a moment.</p>

<p>The others were not listening; Zillah and
Ada had caught sight of the new dresses, were
admiring them and asking eager questions of
their aunt and sister.</p>

<p>"My boy," Mrs. Keith said in moved tones,
"I would rather be the mother of a poor hard
working man of whom it could be said that he
had always been perfectly honest and true, than
of one who had amassed his millions and attained
to the highest worldly honors by fraud
or questionable deeds or words. Remember
that all your life."</p>

<p>"Mother, I will; I have my father's example
to help me as well as yours," the lad replied
with a proud glance at the noble, kindly, intellectual
face of a gentleman who came in at
that instant with Fan in his arms and the two
little boys gamboling about him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Aunt Wealthy, good morning!" he
said in a cheery tone, sitting down beside her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
putting Fan on one knee, and lifting the babe,
who was laughing and crowing with delight at
sight of him, to the other. "I suppose you
have heard the news?"</p>

<p>"That you are going to Indiana, Stuart!
Yes. You are not contented to let well enough
alone?"</p>

<p>"Can't consider it well enough to be barely
making the two ends meet while a growing
family must be constantly increasing my expenses."</p>

<p>"How is this removal to help you? It
will cost a good deal."</p>

<p>"'Nothing venture, nothing have.' I'm
going to a new country where land is cheap.
I shall invest something in that and hope to
see it increase largely in value as the town
grows.</p>

<p>"Then lawyers are not so plenty there but
that some more will be needed as people move
in, and I hope by being on the spot in good
season, to secure extensive practice.</p>

<p>"It will cost the sundering of some very
tender ties," he continued, his face growing
grave almost to sadness, "but we are willing to
bear that for our children's sake. Is it not so;
wife?" and he turned to her with a smile that
spoke volumes of love and confidence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes indeed, Stuart," she answered with
cheerful heartiness. "I shouldn't have hesitated
for a moment if I had been quite sure it
would be the best thing for them; but, as you
know, I'm afraid we can not give them as good
an education there as we might here. However
we have now decided to go, and I can only
hope for the best.</p>

<p>"And do you know," she went on with a
smile directed to the corner where Miss Stanhope
sat, "that since you left us this morning
something has happened that takes away more
than half the pain of the thought of leaving
Lansdale?"</p>

<p>"No; what may that be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" shouted Cyril, turning a
somersault on the carpet. "Aunt Wealthy's
goin' along! Aunt Wealthy's goin' along!"</p>

<p>And then such raptures of delight as were
indulged in by those who had not heard the
news before!</p>

<p>These were interrupted by a summons to
the dinner-table; but when the blessing had
been asked and the plates filled, the talk went
on again, though in a somewhat more subdued
fashion.</p>

<p>"Is there absolutely no danger from the
Indians, Stuart?" asked Miss Stanhope.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"None whatever; most of the tribes have
been removed to the far west; all but one, I
think, and that will probably be taken soon."</p>

<p>"What tribe is it? the Wottapottamies?"</p>

<p>"Pottawottamies; yes."</p>

<p>"Father, will we have to live in wigwams
and dress in skins?" asked Ada, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No; we'll have a house; if it is only a
log-cabin, and we'll carry plenty of clothes
along."</p>

<p>"P'raps dey might det losted on the way,"
suggested Fan.</p>

<p>"Well, pussy, I think we'll find some
stores out there; and if everything else fails
we can always fall back on deerskins."</p>

<p>Lansdale was but a small town; everybody
in it knew the Keiths or knew of them, and by
the next day after their removal had been decided
upon, everybody knew that.</p>

<p>Many regrets were expressed and there
were some offers of assistance with their preparations;
but these were declined with thanks:
"with Aunt Wealthy's good help, and that of
the seamstress already engaged," Mrs. Keith
said "she and Mildred would be able to do all
that was necessary."</p>

<p>They were very busy cutting, fitting and
sewing, day after day, from morning to night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
with occasional interruptions from the little
ones who were too young to go to school but
old enough to roam over house and grounds;
and being adventurous spirits, full of life and
energy, were constantly getting into mischief,
thus furnishing, gratis, a change of works to
mother and eldest sister, who, spite of a hearty
affection for the young rogues, was often sorely
tried by their pranks.</p>

<p>"Have you any cord, Mrs. Keith?" asked
the seamstress, one morning.</p>

<p>"Yes," turning to her work-basket. "Why,
what has become of it? I had two or three
pieces here. And that paper of needles has
disappeared! Mildred did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The children were here half an hour ago,
mother, and I remember seeing Donald peeping
into your basket."</p>

<p>"Run out and see what they have done
with them."</p>

<p>Going into the hall, Mildred stood a moment
listening for some sound to tell her where
the children were. Little voices were prattling
in the garden near at hand. Stepping to the
door she saw the two boys seated on the grass
busied with a kite Rupert had made for them.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she asked, going
nearer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Makin' a longer tail."</p>

<p>"Where did you get that piece of string?"</p>

<p>No answer; only a guilty look on the two
chubby faces.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! it's some cord you took from
mother's work-basket. And now it's wanted;
but you've spoilt it entirely; why did you cut
and knot it so?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Cyril, "you see Don was my
crazy man and I had to tie him; and then I
had to cut the string to get it off, 'cause I
couldn't untie the knots."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mischievous fellows. Another
time don't you take things without leave. Did
you take a paper of needles too?"</p>

<p>"No, we didn't; maybe Fan did."</p>

<p>Mildred went in search of Fan, and found
her digging and planting in her little garden,
the empty needle paper lying near.</p>

<p>"Fan," said Mildred, picking it up, "What
have you done with the needles that were in
this?"</p>

<p>"Sowed 'em in dis bed; and when dey
drows up we'll have lots an' lots for mother an'
you."</p>

<p>"You silly, provoking little puss! needles
don't grow. Show me where you put
them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tan't dey's all round and round in de
gwond."</p>

<p>Mildred took up a bit of stick and poked
about in the fresh earth for a minute or two,
then remarking to herself that it was as bootless
as hunting in a haystack, went into the
house with the report of the hapless fate of the
missing articles.</p>

<p>The boys were there before her, penitently
exhibiting the ruined cord and promising to do
so no more.</p>

<p>"We didn't fink, mother," pleaded Don,
looking up in her face with such a droll mixture
of fun and entreaty in his roguish blue
eyes, that she could not refrain from giving
him a kiss and a smile as she answered, "Ah,
my boys must learn to think and not take
mother's things without leave. Now run away
to your plays and try to be good children."</p>

<p>"Mother, I do think you're a little too easy
with them," Mildred said in a slightly vexed
tone.</p>

<p>"Perhaps; but if I make a mistake, is it
not far better to do so on the side of mercy
than of severity?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so; I shouldn't like to see them
whipped."</p>

<p>Then laughingly she told the story of Fan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
doings, and as needles and cord must be replaced,
put on her bonnet and sallied forth
upon the errand.</p>

<p>Mildred as one of the prettiest, most accomplished,
graceful, and fascinating young ladies
of the place, and belonging to one of the first
families, was a good deal admired, and never
lacked attention at a party, picnic or any sort
of gathering of the young people of the town.</p>

<p>As she left the store where she had made
her purchases, Spencer Hall crossed the street
and joined her.</p>

<p>He was the only son of the wealthiest man
in the place and, because of his great expectations,
looked upon by most of the young girls
and their mammas as a desirable match.</p>

<p>Mildred, however, was of a different opinion,
knowing him to be idle, purse-proud, vain
and conceited.</p>

<p>She therefore returned his greeting rather
coldly; heartily wishing that he had not happened
to see her, or that something would occur
to rid her at once of his undesirable company.</p>

<p>Greatly amazed would the young exquisite
have been could he have read her thoughts;
for he had no doubt that she felt highly gratified
and honored by his notice. Was he not
arrayed in broadcloth suit, silk hat and immaculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
kids, while she wore calico, cotton gloves
and the simplest of straw bonnets? And could
not his father buy hers out ten times over?</p>

<p>His manner was gracious and patronizing
as he remarked&mdash;sauntering along by her side,
"Why, Miss Mildred, can it be true that you
are going to leave us? I don't see what Lansdale
will do without you."</p>

<p>"It is quite true that we are going, Mr.
Hall," she answered, with a slight curl of the
lip; "and I suppose my father and mother
will be missed; but I can not think that my
loss will in any way affect the prosperity of the
town or the happiness of the people."</p>

<p>"Some people's it certainly will," he said,
with increased graciousness, exerting himself
slightly to keep pace with her, as she quickened
her steps to a very rapid walk. "We don't
want to lose you; might it not be possible to
persuade you to remain among us?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; unless my parents should
change their plans and decide to stay. Of
which there is not the least probability."</p>

<p>"Do you know that you are walking very
fast, Miss Mildred?" he said, laughing. "Do
let us slacken our pace a little, for who knows
when we may have the pleasure of walking together
again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must excuse me; I am in great haste.
But there is not the slightest necessity for your
exerting yourself to keep pace with me. It is
broad daylight and I know the way."</p>

<p>"Now don't be sarcastic, my dear young
lady. I'd be willing at any time to make a far
greater exertion for the pleasure of your society;
but if we move so rapidly it will shorten
our interview considerably."</p>

<p>"I have already explained that I am in
haste; there is much to be done in the few
weeks before we leave," the girl answered
coldly, pressing on with accelerated speed.</p>

<p>"Haven't time even for a word with an old
friend, eh? Then good-morning, Miss Keith,"
and turning about in disgust, he sauntered
leisurely along in another direction while she
sped on her way as before.</p>

<p>"Is it possible! what does the girl mean!"
he ejaculated the next minute, as on turning
his head to look after her, he perceived that
Mildred had actually stopped upon the sidewalk&mdash;stopped
to speak to a mutual acquaintance,
a lad a year or two younger than himself,
who was working his own way in the world,
getting an education by the hardest and helping
a widowed, invalid mother.</p>

<p>For Frank Osborne Mildred had the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
respect, though she looked upon him as a mere
boy and was wholly unconscious that to him
she was the embodiment of every virtue and
grace; that her words, looks and smiles were
treasured up in his very heart of hearts; nor
did she dream how unhesitatingly he would
have laid down his life to save hers had it been
in danger. It was only a boy's passion, but it
was deep and strong.</p>

<p>The news of the intended removal of the
Keiths to what, in those days, seemed a far distant
region, had been a great shock to him;
but with the hopefulness of youth he consoled
himself with the resolve to follow and seek her
out&mdash;when in the course of years he should
earn fame and fortune&mdash;though she should be
carried to the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>His eye brightened and his cheek flushed,
as on turning a corner, he came suddenly upon
her in her rapid walk, and she stopped and
held out her hand in friendly greeting.</p>

<p>He took it almost reverentially.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do, Frank? and how is your
mother to-day?" she was saying, her bright
eyes looking straight into his.</p>

<p>"Better, thank you, Miss Mildred. And
you are well? and oh, can it be true that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
are all going so far away?" he asked with a
wistful, longing look.</p>

<p>"Yes; to the land of the Hoosiers, wild
Indians and wolves," she said gayly. "Don't
you envy me?"</p>

<p>"I envy those that go with you," he answered,
sighing. "You won't forget old friends,
Miss Mildred?"</p>

<p>"No; no, indeed, Frank," she said, heartily.
"But good-bye. I must hurry home," and
with a nod and smile she tripped away; to
the satisfaction of Hall who had jealously
watched the whole interview.</p>

<p>He was glad it had been no longer, though
he could not avoid the unpleasant consciousness
that more favor had been shown to "that
pauper" than to himself, the prospective heir
to a comfortable fortune.</p>

<h2>Chapter Third.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Lessons so dear, so fraught with holy truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As those her mother's faith shed on her youth."</span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span>," said Mildred, taking up her sewing
again, "I must work fast to make up for lost
time, for I've set my heart on finishing this
dress of Ada's to-day."</p>

<p>The words had scarcely left her lips when
there came a loud crash and scream from the
hall, followed by a sound of tumbling and rolling.</p>

<p>Up sprang mother, aunt and sister, scattering
scissors, thimbles and work, and rushed
toward the scene of commotion.</p>

<p>They found the stairs, and Fan, who sat
weeping half way up, drenched with water;
while at the foot were scattered fragments of a
large pitcher, Cyril lying among them half
stunned and with the blood streaming from a
cut in his head; Don gazing down upon him
from the landing and adding his mite to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
confusion by screaming, "Oh! oh! oh! he's
deaded! he's deaded!"</p>

<p>"No, he ain't," said Cyril, slowly getting on
his feet. "Mother, I didn't mean to. Please
don't let Milly scold us young ones. Oh, stop
this quick!" putting his hand to his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, sonny, as soon as possible," said Mrs.
Keith, taking his head in her hands and holding
the lips of the wound together. "A basin
of cold water, Milly, quick! and aunt, there is
sticking plaster in the work-table drawer. Hush
Don; don't cry any more, Fan; Cyril isn't much
hurt and mother will soon make it all right."</p>

<p>Her orders were promptly obeyed, the wound
skillfully dressed, Fan's wet clothes changed,
and then inquiry was made as to how it had all
happened.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why," said Cyril, "you see Fan
wanted to wash her hands; 'cause she'd been
diggin' in her garden and dey was all dirty,
and dere wasn't any water in the pitcher and
we brung it down and got it full and I was
carryin' it up and my foot tripped and I fell
down with it and knocked Fan over cause she
was behind me. And I couldn't help it.
Could I, Don?"</p>

<p>"No, you touldna help it," assented Don.
"And Fan touldn't too."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he's dot a bad hurt on his head," put
in Fan pityingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's punished enough, I think," said
the mother, caressing him; "his intentions
seem to have been good; but next time you
want water, dears, come and tell mother or
sister Milly."</p>

<p>"There, the morning's gone," said Mildred,
as bells and whistles began their usual announcement;
"a full hour of it wasted, too,
by the pranks of those children. I hope they've
finished up the business for to-day!"</p>

<p>Vain hope! inactivity was impossible to
those restless spirits: their surplus energy must
be worked off in some way.</p>

<p>They had not been heard from for two hours
and Mrs. Keith had just remarked that she
feared it must be some mischief that was keeping
them so quiet, when shrieks and wails from
three infantile voices, coming from the second
story, appealed strongly to the compassion of
their relatives in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>The call for help was responded to as
promptly as on the previous occasion. Mother,
aunt, and sister flew to the rescue and on entering
the room whence the sounds proceeded,
found Fan locked in the wardrobe and the two
boys seated in the lower drawer of the bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which their weight had caused to tip so far forward
that they could not get out without assistance.
A chair standing so near as to prevent
the bureau from falling entirely to the
floor, had probably saved them from a serious
accident; but there they were, bent nearly
double, legs dangling, vociferous screams issuing
from their throats.</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment for the laughing
mother and aunt to lift up the bureau and
release the two rogues, while Mildred sprang
to the wardrobe, unlocked it and took the sobbing
Fan in her arms.</p>

<p>"You poor dear, who fastened you in
there?"</p>

<p>"Cyril did. He said I stealed and must go
to jail. And&mdash;and I was 'f'aid it would des
tumble over; it shaked so when I tried to det
out."</p>

<p>"The naughty boy!" cried Mildred, flashing
an indignant glance at him as he and Don
crept from the drawer, straightened themselves
and stood up looking very much abashed and
ill at ease.</p>

<p>"Mother, I do think Cyril ought to be punished."</p>

<p>"I didn't hurt her," he muttered, hanging
his head; "and I was goin' to let her out 'fore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
long. And we didn't mean to tumble the
bureau over. Did we Don?"</p>

<p>"No; it dus went yight over its ownse'f,"
chimed in the little brother. "Pease, mamma
we's doin to be dood boys now."</p>

<p>"You might have been very much hurt if
the chair had not been where it was," she said,
composing her features and speaking with becoming
gravity, "I am very thankful for your
escape, and you must never do such things
again. Especially never lock each other into
a wardrobe or closet," she added sitting down,
drawing Fan to her side and caressing her tenderly,
while Miss Stanhope and Mildred restored
the contents of the bureau drawers,
which the boys had unceremoniously tossed
upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"Why, mother?" queried the self-constituted
jailor.</p>

<p>"Because it is very dangerous. Your little
sister might have been frightened into a fit or
have died for want of air to breathe."</p>

<p>Cyril's eyes dilated, then filled with tears as
he seemed to see the little sister he loved so
dearly lying before him white and cold and
dead.</p>

<p>"I won't ever, ever do it again," he said
tremulously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you must be Fan's big brave brother
that she can trust to take care of her and shield
her from harm. I don't believe my Cyril
would be such a mean coward as to hurt a little
girl or anything smaller or weaker than himself,
except for that naughty 'didn't think!'"</p>

<p>"But I didn't hurt her, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, you hurt her feelings very
much."</p>

<p>He considered a moment. "Yes, I s'pose
that's so," he said slowly, "Fan, I'll tell you;
I'm real sorry; and you may be jailor now and
lock me up in that wardrobe."</p>

<p>"No, no! there must be no more such doings,"
quickly interposed mamma.</p>

<p>"Dess I wouldn't do such sing!" said Fan,
wiping away her tears with her chubby little
hand.</p>

<p>"What a room!" said Mildred, shutting the
last bureau drawer and turning to look about
her; "every chair out of place and turned on
its side, the bed all tumbled and bits of paper
scattered over the carpet."</p>

<p>"Pick them up, children, and try to keep
out of mischief for the rest of the day. I must
go back to my sewing," Mrs. Keith said, following
her aunt, who had already left the
room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred staid behind to assist in setting it
to rights.</p>

<p>"You naughty children! really I could
almost enjoy spanking you all round," she exclaimed
directly, as she came upon the fragments
of a delicate china vase belonging to herself,
and a valued letter from a friend torn into
bits.</p>

<p>"Milly," said Cyril solemnly, "s'pose we
should get deaded some day; wouldn't you be
sorry?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I should get deaded," she retorted,
"wouldn't you be sorry for spoiling my
pretty things?"</p>

<p>She was ashamed of her outburst nevertheless,
and the child's words haunted her all the
afternoon.</p>

<p>It was evening; two candles burned on the
sitting-room table, and beside it sat Mildred
and her mother still busily plying their
needles.</p>

<p>The rest of the family were in bed and
Miss Stanhope and the seamstress had gone to
their own homes hours ago.</p>

<p>"My child, put up your work for to-night,"
said Mrs. Keith; "You are looking weary and
depressed; and no wonder, for you have had a
hard day."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"A busy day, mother; but not so hard as
yours, because I have had a walk in the fresh
air while you have been stitch, stitching from
early morning till now. And if you don't forbid
it I shall sit up and work as long as you
do. I consider it one of the eldest daughter's
privileges to share her mother's burdens."</p>

<p>"My dear girl! you are a comfort to me!
I thank God for you every day," the mother
said, looking at her with dewy eyes and a
beautiful smile, "but because you are young
and growing, you need more rest and sleep
than I do. So go, daughter, and never mind
leaving me."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I stay a little longer," pleaded the
girl, "I want one of our nice confidential talks.
O mother, I am so disgusted with myself! I
was very angry with Cyril and Don to-day
when I found they'd broken that vase I valued
so because you gave it to me as a birthday
present; and it was so pretty too&mdash;and torn up
that sweet letter dear Miss Grey wrote me just
before she died."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I didn't know they had done
such damage and I am very sorry for your loss,
dear!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I knew you would be; my
loss of temper, though, was worse than all. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
do wish I knew how you contrive always to be
so patient."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's very often all on the outside,"
the mother answered with a slight smile.
"But I find it a great help in bearing patiently
with the little every day worries, to think of
them as sent, or permitted, by my best Friend&mdash;One
who never makes a mistake&mdash;for my
growth in grace; for you know we grow strong
by resistance."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I am constantly resolving
that I will not give way to my temper, and yet I
keep on doing so; and I grow so discouraged and
so disgusted with myself. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"My child, watch and pray. Our sufficiency
is of God. He is our strength. And
do not look at yourself; try to forget self altogether
in 'looking unto Jesus;' get your mind
and heart full of his lovely image, so full that
there will be no room in it for aught else; and
thus shall you grow into His likeness."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes shone as she looked up into
her mother's earnest face.</p>

<p>"I am sure that must be the way," she said,
low and feelingly, "and I will try it; for I do
long to be like Him, mother; for He is indeed
to me, 'the chiefest among ten thousand and
the one altogether lovely!'"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, how good He is to me!" ejaculated
the mother, glad tears shining in her eyes:
"that you might learn thus to know and love
Him has been the burden of my prayer for you&mdash;for
each of my dear children&mdash;since they first
saw the light."</p>

<p>They worked on in silence for some minutes,
then Mildred seeing a smile playing about
her mother's lips, asked what was the thought
that provoked it.</p>

<p>"A reminiscence of some of your infantile
pranks," her mother answered laughing. "You
should be forbearing with your little brother
and sisters for you were fully as mischievous as
they are.</p>

<p>"Before you could walk I caught you one
day seated in the middle of the table set for
tea, your hand in the sugar bowl, your mouth
full and your face well besmeared.</p>

<p>"You were a great climber and it was difficult
to keep anything out of your way; and
as soon as Rupert could creep he followed you
into danger and mischief; pulling things about,
breaking, tearing, cutting, climbing fences and
trees, and even getting out of windows on to
roofs.</p>

<p>"Besides, you had a perfect mania for tasting
everything that could possibly be eaten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
drunk&mdash;soap, candles, camphor, lye, medicines
whatever you could lay your hands on&mdash;till I
was in constant fear for your lives."</p>

<p>"You poor, dear mother, what a time you
must have had with us!" exclaimed the girl.
"We can never hope to repay you for your
patient love and care."</p>

<p>"My child, I have always felt that my darlings
paid for their trouble as they went along;
their love has always been so sweet to me,"
Mrs. Keith answered, cheerily. "And I can
not tell you how much I enjoy the sweet society
and confidence of my eldest daughter&mdash;the
knowledge that she has no secrets from
me."</p>

<p>"I have not, indeed," Mildred said, heartily,
"as why should I? knowing as I do that
my mother is my best and wisest, as well as
dearest earthly friend."</p>

<p>Then recalling the events of the morning
she gave a laughing account of her interview
with Spencer Hall.</p>

<p>"If I could contemplate the possibility of
leaving you behind it would certainly not be
in his care," her mother said, joining in her
merriment, "and I am glad you have sense
enough not to fancy him."</p>

<p>"Truly I do not in the least; though many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the girls consider him a great catch because
of his father's wealth," said Mildred. "But
really I don't believe he meant anything, and
I felt like showing him that I understood that
very well and resented his trifling; and
wouldn't have been much better pleased if
he had been in earnest."</p>

<h2>Chapter Fourth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"And, like some low and mournful spell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To whisper but one word&mdash;farewell."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Park Benjamin.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> sweet June morning an expectant
group gathered in the shade of the vine-wreathed
porch of Miss Stanhope's pretty cottage.
It consisted of that good lady herself
Mr. and Mrs. Keith and their eight children,
all attired in neat traveling costume, and awaiting
the coming of the stage coach which was to
carry them the first step of their journey&mdash;to the
nearest town situate on the Ohio and Erie
Canal.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Park, the new occupants of
the cottage, were there too, and a few old
neighbors and friends who had run in for a last
good-bye.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith and Mildred turned now and
then, a tearful lingering look upon their deserted
home and this other which was equally
familiar, almost equally dear; Miss Stanhope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
seemed to have some ado to control her feelings
of sadness and anxiety for the future; but Mr.
Keith was in fine spirits in which the children
evidently shared very largely.</p>

<p>Eager to be off, they moved restlessly about
asking again and again, "When will the stage
come?" and kept sending out reconnoitering
parties to see if there were any signs of its approach.</p>

<p>At length they espied it and announced the
fact with joyful exclamations as its four prancing
steeds came sweeping around the corner
and, swaying and rolling, it dashed up to the
gate.</p>

<p>The driver drew rein, the guard sprang
from his lofty perch, threw open the door and
let down the steps.</p>

<p>There were hurried embraces and farewells,
a hasty stowing away of bags, bundles, and
passengers large and small, in the inside, and
of more bulky baggage in the boot of the coach,
the steps were replaced, the door slammed to,
and amid waving of handkerchiefs and a chorus
of good-byes and good wishes, the "toot,
toot!" of the guard's horn, the crack of the
coachman's whip, they swept away down the
street, looking, in all probability, their last
upon many a well known object, many a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
face, nodding and smiling to them from door or
window.</p>

<p>Frank Osborne, at work in his mother's garden,
dropped his hoe to lift his hat and bow as
the stage passed, and to gaze after it with a
longing, lingering look.</p>

<p>Spencer Hall, standing, cigar in mouth, on
the steps of his father's mansion, did likewise.</p>

<p>But Mildred had turned her head away, purposely,
and did not see him.</p>

<p>Never before had Lansdale put on so inviting
an appearance, or the surrounding country
looked so lovely as to-day, while they rolled
onward through the valley and over the hills
now clothed in all the rich verdure of early summer
and basking in the brilliant sunlight occasionally
mellowed and subdued by the flitting
shadow of some soft, white, fleecy like cloud
floating in the deep azure of the sky.</p>

<p>A few hours' drive took our travellers to the
town where they were to exchange the stage for
the canal boat, the packet Pauline. She lay at
the wharf, and having dined comfortably at a
hotel near by, they went on board, taking with
them the luggage brought by the stage.</p>

<p>Their household goods had been dispatched
on the same route some days before.</p>

<p>Here they were in quarters only less confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
than those of the stage, the Pauline's
cabin being so narrow that when the table was
to be set for a meal, most of the passengers had
to go on deck to be out of the way.</p>

<p>All along the side of the cabin ran a
cushioned seat; used for that purpose in the
daytime and as a lower berth at night; other
shelf-like berths being then set up over it; all so
narrow that the occupant could scarcely turn
upon his couch; and the upper ones so close to
the ceiling that it required some care to avoid
striking the head against it in getting in or out.
Also there was an unpleasant dampness about
the bedding.</p>

<p>In the cool of the evening or when the sun
was clouded, the deck was the favorite place of
resort; but there a constant lookout for bridges
must be kept, and to escape them it was sometimes
necessary to throw one's self flat upon
the deck; not the most pleasant of alternatives.</p>

<p>The progress of these packets was so slow
too, that it took nearly a week to reach Cleveland
from the point where our friends embarked.</p>

<p>But this mode of travel had its compensations.
One was the almost absolute safety;
another the ease with which the voyager could
step ashore when the boat was in a lock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
refresh himself with a brisk walk along the
tow-path; boarding her again when the next
lock was reached.</p>

<p>This was done daily by some of the Keith
family, even the very little ones being sometimes
allowed the treat when the weather and
walking were fine and the distance was not too
great.</p>

<p>Passengers were constantly getting off and
on at the locks and the towns along the route,
and often the boat was crowded. It was so
the first night that our friends spent on board;
babies cried, older children fretted and some
grown people indulged in loud complaints of
scant and uncomfortable accommodations;
altogether the cabin was a scene of confusion
and the young Keiths felt very forlorn.</p>

<p>But mother, aunt and older sister were very
patient, soothed, comforted, and at length succeeded
in getting them all to sleep.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Wealthy, saying that she felt
disposed to lie down and rest beside the children,
persuaded Mrs. Keith and Mildred to go
upon deck for an hour to enjoy the moonlight
and the pleasant evening breeze with Mr. Keith
and Rupert, who had been there ever since
supper.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith helped his wife and daughter up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the short flight of steps that led from the stern
to the deck, and found them seats on some of
their own trunks.</p>

<p>There were a number of other passengers
sitting about or pacing to and fro; among
the former a burly German who sat flat on the
deck at the stern end of the boat, his long legs
dangling over the edge, his elbow on his knee
and his bearded chin in his hand, gazing out
idly over the moonlight landscape, while
wreaths of smoke from a pipe in his mouth,
curled slowly up from his lips.</p>

<p>The Pauline glided onward with easy pleasant
motion; all had grown quiet in the cabin
below and the song of the bullfrogs, the dull
thud of the horses' hoofs and the gentle rush of
the water against the sides of the boat, were the
only sounds that broke the stillness.</p>

<p>"How nice it is here!" exclaimed Mildred,
"the breeze is so refreshing, the moonlight so
bewitching!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the country is looking beautiful,"
said her mother, "and one gets a good view
of it here; but I feel somewhat apprehensive in
regard to the bridges. We must be on the
watch for them and dodge in time."</p>

<p>"We will," said her husband; "though we
may pretty safely trust to the steersman; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
his duty to be on the lookout and give timely
warning."</p>

<p>"Well, we're facing in the right direction
to see them," remarked Rupert, "but that
Dutchman back there is not. I s'pose he's safe
enough, though, with the man at the helm to
sing out as we near them."</p>

<p>With that they fell into talk on other
topics, and thought no more of the smoker.</p>

<p>"Bridge!" sang out the steersman, and
down went every head except that of the German,
who sat and smoked on unmoved.</p>

<p>"Bridge!" The cry was repeated in louder,
more emphatic tones.</p>

<p>"Yah, pridge, pridge!" responded the
German straightening up a little, nodding his
head assentingly, but not looking round.</p>

<p>"Bridge!" sang out the steersman for the
third time, "bridge, you stupid lout! dodge
or"&mdash;</p>

<p>But the boat was already sweeping under,
and the bridge taking the German across his
shoulders threw him with sudden violence to
the platform below, whence he rolled over into
the canal, uttering a half stifled cry for help
as the water closed over him.</p>

<p>But he rose again instantly panting and
spluttering, and striking out vigorously for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the boat; he presently succeeded in laying
hold of the edge of the platform, and, the
steersman lending him a helping hand, clambered
on board, crestfallen and dripping, while
the crowd on deck, seeing him safe, indulged
in a hearty laugh at his expense.</p>

<p>"I loss mein bipe," he said ruefully, shrugging
his shoulders and shaking the water from
his clothes.</p>

<p>"Well, you got a free bath in exchange and
may be thankful you didn't lose your life," remarked
the steersman with a grin. "Next
time I call out bridge I guess you'll duck your
head like the rest."</p>

<p>The rain had been falling heavily all night,
but the sun shone brightly, and the clouds were
flying before a high wind that blew fresh and
cool from Lake Erie as the Pauline glided
quietly into Cleveland.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful city!" exclaimed the
young Keiths as they stepped ashore. "Do
let us walk to the hotel, father, if it is not too
far."</p>

<p>"Just as Aunt Wealthy and your mother
say," he replied, taking the baby from his wife.
"I am told it is but a short distance, Marcia;
I will have our heavy baggage carried directly
to the steamer which leaves this afternoon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and Rupert and the girls can take charge of the
satchels and small packages."</p>

<p>The ladies decided in favor of the walk as
affording agreeable exercise and enabling them
to see the city to better advantage than if cooped
up in hack or omnibus, and no one regretted
their choice: they found the wide streets so clean,
the breeze so refreshing and exhilarating, and enjoyed
so very much gazing upon the tall, elegant
looking houses and the pretty things displayed
in the windows of the large, handsome stores.</p>

<p>After a good dinner at the hotel, Mr. Keith,
his wife and older children, went out for another
stroll about the city; Miss Stanhope, who insisted
that she had had exercise enough, and
preferred to stay where she was, taking charge
of the little ones in their absence.</p>

<p>On the return of the pedestrians the whole
party went on board the steamer which was to
convey them across the lake to Detroit. It
was a fine boat, the cabin large and handsome;
staterooms on each side furnished with berths
of far more comfortable size than those of the
canal packets.</p>

<p>The table here was better, too, both in its
appointments and the quality of the food, and
was set in a lower saloon, reached from the
upper one by a flight of broad winding stairs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The children were delighted with the
change and wanted to be on the guards all
afternoon, watching the play of the great stern
wheel, admiring the rainbows in the clouds of
spray it sent up, looking out over the wide
waste of waters, at the islands and an occasional
passing boat, or racing back and forth.</p>

<p>Mildred and Rupert were given charge of
the three little ones and found great vigilance
necessary to prevent Cyril and Don from putting
themselves in peril of their lives. Mildred was
more than once sorely tempted to shake the
young rogues who gave her no peace; but, remembering
and acting upon her mother's advice,
was able to restrain herself and treat them
with uniform gentleness.</p>

<p>She felt rewarded when, as she was putting
them to bed, her mother being busy with the
babe, Don threw his arms impulsively round
her neck and kissing her again and again, said
"I loves you, Milly; you so dood to us naughty
chillens."</p>

<p>"That she is!" assented Cyril, heartily,
"an' I wish I didn't be so bad."</p>

<p>"Well, try again to-morrow to be ever so
good," Mildred answered, tucking them in and
leaving them with a good-night kiss.</p>

<p>She helped her sisters with their preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for the night, then was rewarded with a
delightful evening spent with the older members
of the family in the open air, looking out
upon the beautiful wide expanse of waters, now
starlit and anon illumined by the silvery rays
of the moon as she rose apparently from the
distant eastern edge of the lake and slowly ascended
the azure vault of the heavens, now
shining resplendently and again veiling her
fair face for a moment with a thin floating
cloud.</p>

<p>The next morning the steamer lay at anchor
in Detroit harbor and our friends left her for a
hotel in what was then the principal street of
the city. Here, too, they walked out to view
the land, and passing the stores and public
buildings, found well-shaded streets and handsome
residences with pretty door-yards in
front.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith gave his children their choice of
passing around the lakes in a steamer or in the
sloop Queen Charlotte. They chose the latter
and the next morning the family and their luggage
were transferred to her decks.</p>

<p>The ladies pointed out the articles they
wished carried to their staterooms and followed
in the wake of the bearers.</p>

<p>There was less of show here than on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
steamer they had left, but comfort and convenience
had not been overlooked, and though
Mildred's face clouded a little, it brightened
again in a moment as she noted the cheerful
content in those of her mother and aunt.</p>

<p>They hurried on deck again where Rupert
had been left in charge of the younger children,
to watch the vessel getting under way.</p>

<p>They were lying close to a steamer on whose
other side was a second sloop in quite as close
proximity. All seemed hurry and bustle on
board the three.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we are to start," observed
Mildred, glancing up at the sails which hung
almost motionless on the masts, "for there's
scarcely a breath of wind."</p>

<p>"Don't you see that they're lashing us and
the Milwaukee yonder fast to the steamboat,
one on each side?" said Rupert. "She's to tow
both till the wind gets up."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that the way? she'll have hard work
to do it, I should think."</p>

<p>"She won't growl any way."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not. Which is the captain,
Ru.?"</p>

<p>"That nice jolly looking chap over yonder,
that's giving orders in such a loud peremptory
tone, is Captain Wells, master of the ship; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
blue eyed, brown haired, rosy cheeked stripling
standing near is his son, Edward Wells; and
they're both English; so don't remind them that
this vessel was taken from the British in the
last war."</p>

<p>"Of course not, unless they say something
mean or exasperating about Washington or
America."</p>

<p>"In that case I give you leave to twit 'em
as hard as you like."</p>

<p>"Who was that nice looking man that
helped us on board? I thought father or somebody
called him captain."</p>

<p>"So he is, Captain Jones; but acting as
first mate here. That lady, talking to mother
and Aunt Wealthy, is his wife. They're both
Yankees; so you can relieve your mind occasionally
on the subject of the ship, by a little
private exultation with them.</p>

<p>"Do you notice the contrast between those
two faces?&mdash;mother's and Mrs. Jones'; hers so
dark, mother's so beautifully fair and rosy."</p>

<p>"Who could help noticing it? Rupert, I
do think our mother has just the loveliest face
in the world!"</p>

<p>"Ditto!" he said, gazing at her with a
world of filial love, pride and chivalric admiration
in his handsome eyes.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say what's the use? you may just as well
set still where you hare," growled a voice near
at hand.</p>

<p>The young people turned involuntarily at
the sound, and perceived that the speaker was a
burly, red-faced young Englishman; the one so
politely and kindly addressed, a little meek-eyed
woman of the same nationality, with a
chalky complexion, and washed out appearance
generally, who, as they afterward learned, and
suspected at the time, was the wife of his
bosom.</p>

<p>"'What a bear!" exclaimed Rupert in an
aside to his sister, and drawing her away as he
spoke. "See, we're beginning to move.
Let's go over to the other side where we can
have a better view."</p>

<p>"I presume that's what she wanted to do,"
remarked Mildred, glancing back at the meek-eyed
woman. "And why shouldn't he have
let her?"</p>

<p>"Why, indeed, except that he's a cowardly
bully."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because that's the only kind of man that
would speak so to a decent woman."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Fifth.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"Hark! to the hurried question of despair:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Where is my child?' and echo answers 'where?'"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Byron.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">How</span> did you learn all you've been telling
me, Ru.?" asked Mildred as they stood side by
side watching with interest the Queen Charlotte
and her consorts slowly clearing the harbor.
"Oh, easily enough; young Wells and I
got into talk while you and the others were
down in the cabin; I asked questions and he
answered 'em. Ah, here he comes," he added
looking round, "I'll introduce him for he's a
nice fellow, I'm sure, and it's a good thing to
have a friend at court; in other words to be in
favor with the reigning powers; <i>i. e.</i> the captain
and his nearest of kin. My sister, Miss
Mildred Keith, Mr. Wells."</p>

<p>"Happy to make your acquaintance, Miss,"
said the young sailor, gallantly, lifting his hat
and bowing low. "Hope you'll enjoy your
voyage on the Queen Charlotte. Shall be most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
happy to do all I can to make the trip pleasant
to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly."</p>

<p>He began at once by finding comfortable
seats for them where they were sheltered from
the sun, and had a good view of the Canada
and Michigan shores; and being acquainted
with the localities, and their history, and possessed
of a ready command of language, he
added much to the interest of the scene by the
information he imparted; sometimes unsolicited,
at others in answer to questions.</p>

<p>When they had passed through Detroit
river and so far out into Lake St. Clair that
little could be seen but water and sky, he
offered to show them over the vessel.</p>

<p>They gladly accepted, enjoyed the tour, and
when it was over rejoined the rest of their party
just as the cabin passengers were summoned
to the supper table.</p>

<p>Mildred was seated between Rupert and
Edward Wells; opposite them sat Mr. and
Mrs. Sims, the bullying Englishman and his
meek-eyed wife, and a bachelor gentleman of
pleasing countenance and manners, whom Captain
Wells addressed as Mr. Carr. Next them
were Captain and Mrs. Jones. There were
many more passengers of both sexes, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nationalities, and a variety of ages from infants
in arms, up to hoary headed grandparents,
but with most of them our story has
little or nothing to do.</p>

<p>The two captains, the wife of the one and
the son of the other, were polite and genial,
the fare was excellent, and every one present
seemed disposed to contentment and good
humor except Mr. Sims, who turned up his nose
at the food, snubbed his wife and scowled at
his opposite neighbors; perchance reading too
plainly in the frank, youthful countenances
their disapproval of him.</p>

<p>Mildred so compassionated the long-suffering
wife that, in the course of the evening,
seeing her sitting by herself and looking sad
and lonely, she drew near and opened a conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sims responded readily.</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Miss," she said, making
room for Mildred by her side, "I'm so glad to
'ave some one to speak to, for I gets hawful
'omesick at times."</p>

<p>"Ah, that must be a very trying feeling,"
Mildred said compassionately. "I know nothing
of it myself; for I've never been away
from home or mother for a week at a time."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss, you're fortunate."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you been long in the country?"</p>

<p>"It's barely six months, Miss, since I left
me father's 'ouse in London. We kept an
'otel there; an' that's 'ow I came to know Mr.
Sims; he takin' lodgin' with us while up to
London about some business 'e 'ad with the
lawyers."</p>

<p>"And are your own family all still in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss; hevery one; I left 'em all&mdash;father,
mother, brothers and sisters&mdash;for 'im,"
she answered with a tremble in her voice and
wiping her eyes furtively.</p>

<p>"What a shame he should treat you as he
does!" was the indignant exclamation that rose
to Mildred's lips, but she checked herself in
time, and changed it for, "Then I think he
ought to be very good to you."</p>

<p>"I 'ope we'll be 'appy, Miss, when we're
settled down in a 'ome of our own," remarked
the little woman with a half stifled patient
sigh. "And indeed it's not 'alf so bad as I
expected; I've been hastonished, at finding so
many white women in America. I thought
when I landed in New York I'd be the honly
white woman there. I s'posed all the rest
would be Injuns or niggers."</p>

<p>"Indeed! how relieved you must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
been on discovering your mistake," remarked
Mildred demurely, while her eyes twinkled
with suppressed fun.</p>

<p>"That I was, Miss, as you may well believe;
it quite reconciled me to the country."</p>

<p>The sun rose brightly the next morning
and the young Keiths were early on deck,
romping and racing about, fall of the vivacity
and mirth usually incident to extreme youth
and perfect health.</p>

<p>They were well watched over by their
father, Mildred and Rupert, or there is no
knowing what wild and dangerous pranks
might have been indulged in by Cyril and Don.</p>

<p>The former actually proposed a flying leap
from the deck of the Queen Charlotte to that
of the steamer and was not at all pleased by
the decided veto put upon it by his father.</p>

<p>"I think you might let a fellow try, papa,"
he grumbled, "it would be such fun and I
know I could do it."</p>

<p>"No, you couldna," said Don, peeping over
the ship's side, "it's a big, big place."</p>

<p>"Come over to the other side of the deck,
and stay there," said Mr. Keith, leading them
away.</p>

<p>Rupert followed holding Fan by the hand.
"What was that? what were they throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in?" he asked, stopping suddenly at a sound as
of a heavy body plunging into the water, while
at the same instant a startled cry came from
the deck of the Milwaukee.</p>

<p>"A man overboard!"</p>

<p>"A man overboard!" the fearful cry was
taken up and repeated on all sides amid the
rush of many feet and the quick, sharp imperative
words of command.</p>

<p>Almost instantly a boat was lowered and
strong arms were pulling with swift, vigorous
strokes for the spot, already left far behind,
where the splash of the falling body had been
heard, and keen eyes were eagerly searching
the waste of waters; the crews and passengers
of the three vessels crowding the decks and
following their movements in breathless anxiety
and suspense.</p>

<p>They pulled backward and forward, calling
out to the drowning one that help was near.</p>

<p>"Ah, yonder he is at last!" cries a woman's
voice in exultant tones; "there he is with his
head above water, for I see his hat."</p>

<p>"And they see him too, and are pulling toward
him with all their might!"</p>

<p>"Ah, they're up with him! they have him
now! hurrah!" and a wild cheer rose from hundreds
of throats.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>But it died away in a groan.</p>

<p>"It was his hat&mdash;only his hat, poor fellow.
And they've given it up and are coming back
without him!" sighs the woman who had been
the first to raise the alarm.</p>

<p>Every face wears a look of sadness for the
few moments of silent waiting as the rowers
slowly return.</p>

<p>They gain the deck of the Milwaukee; one
of them&mdash;a lad of nineteen or twenty, a rough,
hardy sailor&mdash;comes forward with a subdued
manner&mdash;in strange contrast to his accustomed
rude hilarity&mdash;lips white and quivering, tears
in his manly eyes.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother," he says, low and huskily,
drawing near this woman with tottering steps,
"don't&mdash;don't take it too hard. I&mdash;I couldn't
bear to see you. I did my best; we all did;
but we couldn't find him; and here's his hat.
It&mdash;it was little Billy."</p>

<p>"My boy! mine! my little one!" she
shrieked, and fell fainting into the arms of her
elder son.</p>

<p>There was not a dry eye among the spectators,
and as the sad story spread to the other
vessels many a tremulous tone and falling tear
attested the pity and sympathy of those who
told the tale and those who listened to it.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how did it happen?" queried one and
another; and the answer was, "He was jumping
back and forth from one vessel to another,
and fell in between the Milwaukee and the
steamer; and it is conjectured that he must
have been struck by the wheel, as he did not
come up again."</p>

<p>"And it might have been one of ours,"
sobbed Mrs. Keith, clasping her babe to her
breast, while her eye glanced from one to another
of her darlings. "Ah, how frightened I
was when I heard the cry. I don't know how
I got up the cabin steps! for I thought it was
perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tears choked her utterance; tears of mingled
gratitude for herself and sorrow for the
bereaved mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, it might have been you, Cyril or
Don; and think how poor mother's heart would
have been broken, and mine too," Mr. Keith
added, sitting down and taking one on each
knee. "Now do you want to try jumping
across like that boy did?"</p>

<p>They shook their heads, gazing up into his
face with awe-struck countenances.</p>

<p>The sad event of the morning seemed to
have exerted a subduing influence upon all the
passengers; it was a very quiet day on board.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The calm continued throughout the day
but a breeze sprang up in the night and the
vessels parted company.</p>

<p>By daylight the breeze had stiffened into a
wind that made the lake very rough; the ship
tossed about on the waves with a motion by no
means agreeable to the land lubbers in her
cabin and steerage; everything not made fast
to floor or walls went dashing and rolling from
side to side of stateroom or saloon; few of the
passengers cared to breakfast, and those who
made the attempt had to do so under serious
difficulties&mdash;table and floor being both inclined
planes, sloping now in one direction now in another.</p>

<p>They passed a miserable day, confined to
the cabin, for the rain was falling heavily and
the great waves would now and then sweep
across the deck.</p>

<p>Still the captain assured them the storm
was not a bad one and they were in no danger.</p>

<p>By the next day it had abated so that they
could seek the outer air, going about without
experiencing much difficulty in preserving the
centre of gravity; and nearly every one had so
far recovered from the deathly sea-sickness as
to be able to appear at meals.</p>

<p>Life on shipboard which had seemed quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
dreadful during the long hours of the storm,
became very tolerable again.</p>

<p>The older people promenaded the deck or
sat there with book or work, or merely chatting
and looking out upon the restless waters, while
the children amused themselves with their
plays or in running about exploring every nook
and cranny and making acquaintance with the
sailors who seemed to enjoy their innocent prattle
and merry ways.</p>

<p>All the Keiths had suffered from sea-sickness
and Mildred was among the last to recover;
it was not until towards sunset of the second
day that she could be induced to leave her berth
and allow her father to assist her up the cabin
stairs to the deck.</p>

<p>Here a couch had been prepared for her and
the loving hands of mother and aunt busied
themselves in making her comfortable. Brothers
and sisters gathered rejoicingly around.
Mrs. Jones brought a glass of lemonade, Mrs.
Sims offered smelling salts, some one else a fan,
and presently the two captains and young Wells
came up to offer their congratulations on her
recovery.</p>

<p>Then Cyril and Don led up and introduced
Mr. Carr, the bachelor gentleman with whom
they had already formed a firm friendship.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's a real nice man, Milly," said Cyril;
"knows lots of stories and games and things,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' p'ays wis boys," put in Don, "and tan
do every fing."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's weal dood," chimed in Fan,
"and I likes him."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my little maid," said the gentleman,
laughing and stroking her curls. "Now
if you could only get your sister to look at me
through your spectacles."</p>

<p>"Why, I hasn't dot any 'pectacles!" exclaimed
the child, opening her eyes very wide.
"Maybe papa buy me some when I dets an old
lady. Den I lets Milly 'ook froo."</p>

<p>"That's my good, generous little sister,"
Mildred said, laughing, "and if I'm so fortunate
as to get glasses first, you shall borrow
them whenever you wish."</p>

<p>"Now go to your plays, dears, and let sister
rest till she feels better," said their mother.</p>

<p>"Please tum wis us, Mr. Tarr," said Don,
tugging at that gentleman's coat.</p>

<p>"Don, Don, you must not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, don't reprove him," interposed the
gentleman, lifting the child to his shoulder and
prancing away with him, while the little fellow
shouted with laughter and delight.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't he a nice man?" cried Zillah and
Ada, looking after him, "we all like him ever
so much."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the mother, "but I am very
much afraid my children impose upon his good
nature."</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you, Mrs. Keith;
he is surely able to take care of himself. Besides
it's quite evident that he enjoys their society
as much as they do his," said Edward Wells,
taking a seat near Mildred's couch, where he
remained chatting in a lively strain with her
and the other ladies until it was time for them
to retire to the cabin.</p>

<p>Fair weather and favorable winds made the
remaining days of the voyage a pleasure till one
bright June morning they entered the Straits
of Mackinaw and reaching the island of the
same name, anchored in front of its fort.</p>

<p>The captain, informing his passengers that
the ship would lie there for a day or two, good-naturedly
offered to take ashore any or all who
would like to go.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody eagerly accepted. The
boats put off from the ship, each with a full
complement of passengers, whom they landed
just under the white walls of the fortress, situate
on a bluff one hundred and fifty feet high.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing up a flight of stone steps they entered
the parade ground. It was smooth, hard
and clean as a well swept floor. They walked
across and about it, viewing the officers' quarters
(on the outside) and the barracks of the
men, walked along by the wall, noting how it
commanded the harbor and the village of Mackinaw,
with its great guns, beside each of which
lay a pile of black balls heaped up in pyramidal
form.</p>

<p>Then they visited the town, saw some Indians
and bought curious little bark baskets ornamented
with porcupine quills, blue, red and
white, and filled with maple sugar; moccasins,
too, made of soft skins and heavily trimmed
with bead work, all manufactured by the
Indians.</p>

<p>The young Keiths were made happy with
a pair of moccasins apiece from their father,
bark baskets from their mother and aunt, and
unlimited maple sugar from their friend Mr.
Carr.</p>

<p>They returned to the ship tired but full of
content.</p>

<p>They were as usual early on deck the next
morning, a little before the rising of the sun,
for they "liked to see him come up out of the
water."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"How very still it is! hardly a breath
of air stirring," Mildred was saying to her
father as Edward Wells drew near the little
group, all standing together looking eagerly
for the first glimpse of the sun's bright face.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are becalmed," said Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"And very possibly may be detained here
for several days in consequence," added Edward,
greeting them with a cheerful good-morning.
"In that case we will have an opportunity to
explore the island. May I have the pleasure
of being your guide in so doing?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean all of us?" queried Cyril.</p>

<p>"Yes, my man; if you will all go?" answered
the sailor lad; but the glance of his
eye seemed to extend the invitation to Mildred
in particular.</p>

<p>"O father, can we? can we?" chorused the
children.</p>

<p>"We will see;" he said. "Now watch or
you'll miss the sight we left our beds so early
for."</p>

<p>The matter was under discussion at the
breakfast table and afterward, and it was decided
that all might go ashore, but that the
walk under contemplation was too long for the
little ones.</p>

<p>Ada Keith was the youngest of that family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
who was permitted to go; but others joined
them and Edward found himself at the head of
quite a party of explorers.</p>

<p>Ada came back looking heated, weary and
troubled. "O mother," she cried, with tears in
her eyes, "we saw a cave where some Frenchmen
were hiding from the Indians and got
smoked to death; the Indians did it by building
a fire at the cave's mouth, because they
couldn't get at them to kill them some other
way. Oh, I'm so afraid of the savages; do
persuade father to take us all back to Ohio
again!"</p>

<p>The mother soothed and comforted the
frightened child with caresses and assurances
of the present peaceable disposition of the Indians,
and at length succeeded in so far banishing
her fears that she was willing to proceed
upon her journey.</p>

<p>However, the calm continuing, nearly a
week passed and many excursions had been
made to the island before they could quit its
harbor.</p>

<p>At length one day directly after dinner, a
favorable wind having sprung up, the good ship
weighed anchor and pursuing her westward
course passed out of the straits into Lake
Michigan.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>All night she flew before the wind and
when our friends awoke the following morning
she rode safely at anchor in the harbor of
Chicago.</p>

<p>Though a large city now, it was then a
town of less than five thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>This was the port of the Queen Charlotte
and her passengers must be landed, her cargo
discharged.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of regret on both sides
that her officers and the Keiths parted; Edward
Wells taking an opportunity to say in an
undertone to Mildred that he hoped they would
sometime meet again.</p>

<p>St. Joseph, on the opposite side of the lake,
was the next port whither the Keiths were
bound. A much smaller vessel carried them
across.</p>

<p>They had a rough passage, wind and rain
compelling them to keep closely housed in a
little confined cabin, and were glad to reach
the town of St. Joseph; though they found it
but a dreary spot, no grass, no trees, the hotel
a large, barn-like, two story building, with the
hot summer sun streaming in through its windows
without hindrance from curtain or blind;
for the rain ceased about the time of their
arrival and the sun shone out with fervid heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
during the two or three days that they were
detained there, resting the Sabbath day and
awaiting the arrival of their household goods
before ascending the St. Joseph river, on which
Pleasant Plains, their final destination, was
situated.</p>

<p>There were no railroads in that part of the
country then, nor for many years after; I think
there was no stage route between the two
places; there were no steamers on the river;
the best they could do was to take a keel-boat.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased and the sun shone
brightly on the rippling, dancing waters of the
lake and river, on the little town and the green
fields and forests of the adjacent country, as
they went on board the keel-boat Mary Ann,
and set out upon this the last stage of their long
journey.</p>

<p>The boatmen toiled at their oars and the
Mary Ann moved slowly on against the current,
slowly enough to give our travelers abundance
of time to take in the beauties of the
scenery; which they, the older ones at least,
did not fail to do.</p>

<p>Much of it was unbroken forest, but they
passed sometimes a solitary clearing with its
lonely log cabin, sometimes a little village.
The river flowed swiftly along, clear and sparkling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
between banks now low, now high, green
to the water's edge.</p>

<p>The sun was nearing the western horizon
as, at last, the boat was run in close to shore
and made fast, with the announcement, "Here
we are, strangers; this here's the town of
Pleasant Plains."</p>

<h2>Chapter Sixth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Nor need we power or splendor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wide hall or lordly dome;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The good, the true, the tender,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">These form the wealth of home."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hale.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Pleasant Plains</span> considered itself quite a
town. It stood high above the river on two
plains, the upper familiarly known as the
"Bluff." It was laid out in very wide, straight
streets, crossing each other at right angles;
there were perhaps two hundred dwelling
houses, principally frame, but with a goodly
proportion of log cabins and a respectable
sprinkling of brick buildings.</p>

<p>The county seat, it had its court-house and
jail; there were some half dozen stores where
almost everything could be had, from dress
goods to butter and eggs, and from a plowshare
to a fine cambric needle; two taverns, as many
blacksmith, shoemaker, and carpenter shops, a
flouring mill and a bakery.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Also two churches belonging to different
denominations; both frame structures, of extremely
plain and unpretentious architecture,
with bare walls, uncurtained windows, rough,
uncarpeted floors, and rude hard benches in
lieu of pews.</p>

<p>No thought of architectural beauty or even
of comfort and convenience, beyond that of
mere protection from the weather, seemed to
have entered the minds of any of the builders
here; the houses were mere shells; with no
cupboards or closets or the slightest attempt at
ornamentation.</p>

<p>Nor was their unsightliness concealed by
vines, trees, or shrubbery; almost every one of
the beautiful monarchs of the forest once adorning
the locality had been ruthlessly felled, and
a stump here and there was all that was left to
tell of their former existence.</p>

<p>As the keel of the Mary Ann grated on the
gravelly shore, a tall figure in rough farmer
attire came springing down the bank, calling
out in tones of unfeigned joy, "Hello, Keith!
Come at last&mdash;wife, children, and all; eh?
I'm glad to see ye! Never was more delighted
in my life."</p>

<p>And the speaker catching Mr. Keith's hand
in his shook it with hearty good will, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
treating the rest of the party in like manner,
as with his and Mr. Keith's assistance, each in
turn stepped from the boat.</p>

<p>Mr. George Ward was an old client and
friend of Mr. Keith's, who had been long urging
this removal.</p>

<p>"I declare I wish I lived in town for a few
days now," he went on, "but we're three mile
out on the prairie, as you know, Keith. I have
my team here, though, and if you like to pile
into the wagon, all of you, I'll take you home
with me, as it is."</p>

<p>The hospitable invitation was declined with
thanks.</p>

<p>"There are quite too many of us, Mr.
Ward," Mrs. Keith said, smilingly, "and we
want to get into a house of our own just as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, so your husband wrote me; and
I've been looking round for you. But the
best that's to be had will seem a poor place to
you, Mrs. Keith, after what you've left behind
in Lansdale."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but of course we must expect
to put up with many inconveniences and
probably some hardships even, for the first few
years," she answered, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's so, but I hope you'll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
yourselves paid for it in the long run. Now
shall I take you to the Union Hotel? You
can't, of course, get into your own house to-night.</p>

<p>"Here, let me carry you, bub," picking up
Cyril, "the soil's real sandy here and makes
heavy walking."</p>

<p>"If, as I presume from your recommendation
of it, it is your best house of entertainment,"
Mr. Keith said, in reply to the question.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, there's only one other, and it's a
very poor affair," returned Mr. Ward, leading
the way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior, the landlady, a pleasant-faced,
middle-aged woman, with kind, motherly manners,
met them at the door with a welcome
nearly as hearty as that of their old time
friend.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," she said, bustling
about to wait upon them, "We've plenty o'
room here in town for the right sort o' folks,
and glad to get 'em."</p>

<p>She had taken them into her parlor, the
only one the house afforded.</p>

<p>The furniture was plain&mdash;a rag carpet,
green paper blinds, a table with a rod and
black cover, windsor chairs, two of them rocking
chairs with chintz-covered cushions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rest straight-backed and hard; on the high
wooden mantel shelf an old-fashioned looking-glass,
a few shells and two brass candlesticks;
these last bright as scouring could
make them.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it must seem but a poor place
to you, ladies," she continued, pushing forward
a rocking chair for each. "And you're dreadful
tired, ain't you? with your long journey.
Do sit down and rest yourselves."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, and everything looks
very nice indeed," Mrs. Keith answered, looking
up at her with a pleased smile as she
accepted the offered seat, and began untying
her baby's bonnet strings.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I, for one, didn't expect to find
half as good accommodations out in these western
wilds," remarked Aunt Wealthy, glancing
round the room. "I thought you had no floors
to your carpets."</p>

<p>"No floors? oh yes; rather rough to be
sure;&mdash;carpenters here don't make the best of
work; and I think sometimes I could a'most
plane a board better myself&mdash;but to get the
carpets is the rub; we mostly make 'em ourselves
and the weavin's often done so poor that
they don't last no time hardly. Soil's sandy,
you see, and it cuts the carpets right out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"They say this country's hard on women
and oxen," put in Mr. Ward, "and I'm afraid
it's pretty true."</p>

<p>"Now don't be frightening them first
thing, Mr. Ward," laughed the landlady.
"Come, take off your things and the children's,
ladies, and make yourselves to home. Here,
just let me lay 'em in here," she went on, opening
an inner door and revealing a bed covered
with a patch-work quilt.</p>

<p>"You can have this room if you like, Mrs.
Keith; I s'pose you'd prefer a downstairs one
with the baby and t'other little ones? There
is a trundle bed underneath that'll do for them.</p>

<p>"And the rest of you can take the two
rooms right over these. They're all ready and
you can go right up to 'em whenever you like.
Is there anything more I can do for you now?"</p>

<p>The query was answered in the negative.</p>

<p>"Then I'll just excuse myself," she said;
"for I must go and see to the supper; can't
trust girls here."</p>

<p>She passed out through another door, leaving
it ajar.</p>

<p>"That's the dining-room, I know, Fan,
'cause I see two big tables set," whispered Cyril
peeping in, "and there's not a bit of carpet
on the floor. Guess they're cleanin' house."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, wife, I'll have to leave you for a little,
I must see to the landing of our goods,"
said Mr. Keith, taking his hat. "Will you
go along, Ward?"</p>

<p>"And let us go up and look at our rooms,
girls," said Mildred to her sisters. "Mayn't
we, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go and make yourselves neat for the
supper table."</p>

<p>They came back reporting bare floors
everywhere, of boards none too well planed
either, but everything scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>"Then we may well be content," said their
mother. The gentlemen returned and the
guests were presently summoned, by the ringing
of a bell on top of the house, to the supper
table, which they found furnished with abundance
of good, wholesome well-cooked food.</p>

<p>And they were really able to make a very
comfortable meal, despite the presence of deli
ware, two-pronged steel forks, and the absence
of napkins.</p>

<p>"What about the goods, Stuart?" asked
Mrs. Keith on their return to the parlor.</p>

<p>"I have had them carted directly to the
house; that is, I believe the men are at it now."</p>

<p>"The house?"</p>

<p>"The one Ward spoke of. I have taken it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
It was Hobson's choice, my dear, or you should
have seen it first."</p>

<p>"Can I see it now?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, if you choose; it won't be dark
yet for an hour. If you and Aunt Wealthy
will put on your bonnets, I'll take you round."</p>

<p>"Ada and me, too, father?" cried Zillah
eagerly.</p>

<p>"And Fan and Don and me?" chorused
Cyril.</p>

<p>"You couldn't think of going without your
eldest son;" said Rupert, looking about for his
hat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith turned an inquiring eye upon
her husband.</p>

<p>"Is it far?"</p>

<p>"No; even Fan can easily walk it. Let
them come. You, too, Mildred," taking the
babe from her arms. "I'll carry baby."</p>

<p>"We'll make quite a procession," laughed
the young girl. "Won't the people stare?"</p>

<p>"What if they do? who of us cares?"</p>

<p>"Not I!" cried Rupert, stepping back from
the doorway with a commanding wave of the
hand, "Procession will please move forward
Mr. Keith and wife taking the lead, Miss Stanhope
and Miss Keith next in order, Zilly and
Ada following close upon their heels, the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
inseparables after them, while Marshal Rupert
brings up the rear to see that all are in line."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed at this sally while they
promptly fell into line as directed, passed out
upon the sidewalk and pursued their way
through the quiet streets.</p>

<p>People did stare to be sure, from open doors
and windows, some asking, "Who are they?"
others answering "New comers and they've got
a big family to support."</p>

<p>Some remarked that they were nice looking
people; while others shook their heads wisely,
or dubiously, and said they "expected they
were real stuck up folks;&mdash;dressed so dreadful
fine."</p>

<p>However, the subjects of these charitable
comments did not overhear, and therefore were
not disturbed by them.</p>

<p>"Do you see that yellow frame yonder,
wife?" Mr. Keith asked as they turned a corner.</p>

<p>"With the gable-end to the street and two
doors in it, one above and one below?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"It looks like a warehouse."</p>

<p>"That's what it was originally intended for;
but finding it not available for that purpose, the
owner offered it for rent."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"And is it the one you have rented?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a poor place to take you to, my dear
but, as I told you, it was Hobson's choice."</p>

<p>"Then we'll make the best of it and be
thankful."</p>

<p>"What a horrid old thing!" remarked Mildred
in an undertone, heard only by Aunt
Wealthy.</p>

<p>"We'll hope to find the inside an improvement
on the out," was the cheerful rejoinder.</p>

<p>"It has need to be, I should say!" cried
the girl as they drew near. "Just see! it
fronts on two streets and there's not a bit of a
space separating it from either; doors open
right out on to a sand bank."</p>

<p>"That's what was made by digging the cellar,"
said Rupert.</p>

<p>"There's a big yard at the side and behind,"
said Zillah.</p>

<p>"Something green in it, too," added Ada,
whose sight was imperfect.</p>

<p>"Nothing but a crop of ugly weeds," said
Mildred, ready to cry as memory brought
vividly before her the home they had left with
its large garden carpeted with green grass,
adorned with shrubbery and filled with the
bloom of summer flowers.</p>

<p>The June roses must be out now and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
woodbine&mdash;the air sweet with their delicious
perfume&mdash;and they who had planted and
tended them, so far away in this desolate looking
spot.</p>

<p>"Not a tree, a shrub, a flower or a blade of
grass!" she went on, sighing as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Never mind, we'll have lots of them next
year, if I plant every one myself," said Rupert.</p>

<p>The last load of their household goods had
just been brought up from the river, the men
were carrying in the heavy boxes and setting
them down upon the floor of the front room.
The door stood wide open and they all walked in.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of a hall!" exclaimed Mildred,
"not a cupboard or closet; nothing but four
bare walls and two windows each side of the
front door."</p>

<p>"Yes, the floor and ceilings," corrected
Rupert.</p>

<p>"And another door on the other side,"
said Ada, running and opening it.</p>

<p>"Not a mantelpiece to set anything on, nor
any chimney at all! How on earth are we
going to keep warm in the winter time?" Mildred
went on, ignoring the remarks of her
younger brother and sister.</p>

<p>"With a stove, Miss; pipes run up through
the floor into the room above; there's a flue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
there," said one of the men, wiping the perspiration
from his forehead with the sleeve of
his checked shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith stopped to settle with the men
for their work, and the others walked on into
the next room.</p>

<p>It was as bare and more dreary than the
first; somewhat larger, but had only one window,
that and an outside door, opening directly
upon the side street.</p>

<p>Back of the two rooms and in a line with
them, was the kitchen; smaller than either of
the other rooms, but provided with a chimney
and fireplace; also a small, dark closet under a
flight of steep and crooked stairs which led
from it to the story above.</p>

<p>This, as they found on climbing up to it,
consisted of two rooms, the first extending over
kitchen and sitting-room, the other over the
front room and of exactly the same size.</p>

<p>The stairs led directly into the first room
and it must be passed through to reach the
second; therefore had not the recommendation
of privacy.</p>

<p>"What a house!" grumbled the children;
"how'll we ever live in it? Such a few rooms
and not a bit nice."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith stood in the middle of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
large, barn-like upper room, saying never a
word, but her heart sinking lower and lower as
she glanced from side to side taking in the
whole situation.</p>

<p>Aunt Wealthy saw it and came to the rescue.
"Never mind, dearie; it will look very
different when we have unpacked and arranged
your furniture. With the help of curtains
several rooms can be made out of this, and
we'll do nicely."</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt we shall, auntie," Mrs.
Keith answered with determined cheerfulness.
"That front room shall be yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! you and Stuart must take that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm quite set on having my own way in
this," interrupted the younger lady in her turn.
"It is the best room, and you must take it.
Don't hesitate or object, for I should be afraid
to have my little ones in there with that outside
door opening on to nothing," she concluded,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, wife, what do you think?" asked
Mr. Keith, coming up the stairs.</p>

<p>"That we can be very happy here if we
make up our minds to be content with our lot."</p>

<p>"That is like you, Marcia; always ready to
make the best of everything," he said, with a
pleased look.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it's a dreadful place!" exclaimed
Mildred, "like a great barn; and so dirty!
plaster all over the floor and spattered on the
windows too."</p>

<p>"I hope it can be cleaned," her father said,
laughing at her rueful face. "Mrs. Prior can
probably tell us where to find a woman to
do it."</p>

<p>A little more time was spent in discussing
plans for the arrangement of the inside of the
dwelling; then they stepped into the side-yard
and viewed it from the out.</p>

<p>A great dead wall of rough weather boarding
broken by one window only and that in
the second story, was what met their view as
they looked up; down below, first a heap of
sand, beyond that a wilderness of weeds and
brushwood.</p>

<p>"I'm dumb with despair!" cried Mildred,
folding her hands with a tragical air.</p>

<p>"Can dumb folks talk?" asked Cyril.</p>

<p>"As ugly as mud this side," remarked
Zillah, turning up her nose scornfully as she
scanned the unsightly wall.</p>

<p>"We'll cover it with vines," said Aunt
Wealthy.</p>

<p>"And I'll clear the yard and sod it," added
Rupert, seizing a great mullein stalk and pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
it up by the roots as he spoke. "Twon't
be nearly so hard as the clearing the early pioneers
of Ohio had to do, our grandfathers
among the rest."</p>

<p>"That's the right way to look at it, my
boy," responded Mr. Keith, heartily. "Come
now, we'll lock up the house and go back to
our hotel for the night."</p>

<p>"There's a log house nearly opposite," remarked
Rupert, when they were in the street
again, "and the next is a real shabby one-and-a-half-story
frame with a blacksmith shop attached.
We haven't the worst place in town
after all. Ho! look at the sign, 'G. Lightcap;'
what a name! 'specially for a blacksmith."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior joined her guests in the parlor
after the younger portion had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you like the house?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall be able to make ourselves
comfortable there," Mr. Keith answered, in a
cheerful tone.</p>

<p>"You can get possession right away, I
s'pose."</p>

<p>"Yes; and want to move in as quickly as
possible, but must have some cleaning done
first."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior recommended a woman for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
without waiting to be asked, and offered to
"send round" at once and see if she could be
engaged for the next day.</p>

<p>The offer was accepted with thanks and the
messenger brought back word that Mrs. Rood
would be at the house by six o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>"But," suggested Aunt Wealthy in dismay,
"she'll want hot water, soap, cloths, scrubbing
brushes!"</p>

<p>"I'll lend a big iron kettle to heat the
water," said the landlady; "a fire can be made
in that kitchen fireplace, you know, or out
doors, with the brush wood."</p>

<p>"And brushes and soap can be had at the
stores, I presume," suggested Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"Yes; and if they ain't open in time, I'll
lend mine for her to start on."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Mrs. Keith.
"But, Stuart, we may as well unpack our own;
I can tell you just which box to open."</p>

<p>"What a woman you are for doing things
systematically, Marcia," he said, admiringly.
"Yours is the best plan, I think. Can we be
up in season to be on hand there at half-past
five, think you?"</p>

<p>"We can try," she answered brightly,
"Mrs. Prior, where is your market?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"We haven't got to that yet, ma'am," replied
the landlady, laughing and shaking her
head.</p>

<p>"No market? why how do you manage
without?"</p>

<p>"There's butcher shops where we can buy
fresh meat once or twice a week&mdash;beef, veal,
mutton, lamb, just whatever they happen to
kill&mdash;and we put up our own salt pork, hams,
dried beef, and so forth, and keep codfish and
mackerel on hand.</p>

<p>"Most folks have their own chickens, and
the country people bring 'em in too; and butter
and eggs and vegetables; though a good
many town folks have garden sass of their own
raisin'; keep a cow and make their own butter."</p>

<p>"That's the most independent way," remarked
Mr. Keith. "I think I must have a
cow; if I can get a girl who can milk. Do
you know of a good girl wanting a place, Mrs.
Prior?"</p>

<p>"I wish I did; but they're dreadful scarce
sir; and so sassy! you can't keep 'em unless
you let 'em come to the table with the family;
and you must be mighty careful what you ask
'em to do."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Seventh.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"I feel my sinews slacken'd with the fright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a cold sweat thrills down all o'er my limbs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As if I were dissolving into water."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dryden's Tempest.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lightcaps were at supper; father and
eldest son, each of whom stood six feet in his
stockings, with shirt sleeves rolled up above
their elbows, displaying brown sinewy arms;
the mother in a faded calico, grizzled hair
drawn straight back from a dull, careworn
face and gathered into a little knot behind in
which was stuck a yellow horn comb; years of
incessant toil and frequent exposure to sun and
wind had not improved a naturally dark, rough
skin, and there was no attempt at adornment
in her attire, not a collar or a ruffle to cover
up the unsightliness of the yellow, wrinkled
neck.</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane, the eldest daughter, seated at
her father's right hand, was a fac-simile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
what the mother had been in her girlhood,
with perhaps an added touch of intelligence
and a somewhat more bold and forward manner.</p>

<p>There were besides several younger children
of both sexes, quite ordinary looking creatures
and just now wholly taken up with the business
in hand;&mdash;vieing with each other in the
amount of bread and butter and molasses, fried
potatoes and fried pork they could devour in a
given space of time.</p>

<p>"Some new comers in town, mother," remarked
Mr. Lightcap, helping himself to a
second slice of pork. "The keelboat Mary
Ann come up the river with a lot of travellers."</p>

<p>"Who, father? somebody that's going to
stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that lawyer we heerd was comin',
you know. What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Keith," said Rhoda Jane, "I heerd Miss
Prior tell Damaris Drybread last Sunday after
meetin'. And so they've come, hev they?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I had occasion to go up street a bit
ago, and saw George Ward takin' 'em to the
Union Hotel; the man hisself and two or three
wimmin folks and a lot of young uns."</p>

<p>"Damaris was wishing there'd be some
children;" remarked Rhoda Jane, "she wants
more scholars."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"It don't foller they'd go to her if there
was," put in her brother.</p>

<p>"Oh now you just shut up, Goto! you
never did take no stock in Damaris."</p>

<p>"No, nor you neither, Rhoda Jane; 'cept
once in a while just fur contrariness. No, I
don't take no shine to Miss Drybread; she's a
unmitigated old maid."</p>

<p>"I wish the man had been a doctor and
good on curin' the agur," said Mrs. Lightcap,
replenishing her husband's cap. "What's up
now, Rhoda Jane?" as that damsel suddenly
pushed back her chair, sprang up, and rushed
through the adjoining room to the front door.</p>

<p>"A wagon goin' by filled full of great boxes
o' goods," shouted back the girl. "There
they're stoppin' at the yaller house on the corner.
Come and look."</p>

<p>The whole family, dropping knives and
forks, the children with hands and mouths full,
ran pell mell to door and windows to enjoy the
sight.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's up, father? are we goin'
to have a new store over there, think?" queried
Mrs. Lightcap, standing on the outer step with
her hands on her hips, her gaze turned steadily
in the direction of the corner house.</p>

<p>"Dunno, mother; b'lieve I'll jest step over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and ask. Come along Goto, I guess they'd like
some help with them thar big boxes."</p>

<p>They were kind-hearted, neighborly folk&mdash;those
early settlers of Pleasant Plains, always
ready to lend a helping hand wherever it was
needed.</p>

<p>"It's the new lawyer feller's traps," announced
Mr. Lightcap, as he and his son rejoined
the waiting, expectant wife and children; "he's
took the house and we'll have 'em for neighbors."</p>

<p>There was another rush to the door, half an
hour later, when the Keiths were seen passing
on their way to inspect their future abode.</p>

<p>"The prettiest gal I ever see," remarked
Gotobed, gazing admiringly after Mildred's
graceful, girlish figure.</p>

<p>"They look like eastern folks," said his
mother. "Won't they wish they'd staid where
they was when they find out how hard 'tis to
get help here?"</p>

<p>"Real stuck up folks; dressed to kill,"
sneered Rhoda Jane. "Look at the white pantalets
on them young uns! and the girl's got a
veil on her bunnit."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the harm?" asked her brother.
"If you had as pretty a skin, I guess you'd be
for takin' care of it too."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! beauty that's only skin deep
won't last," and with a toss of the head Miss
Lightcap walked into the house in her most
dignified style.</p>

<p>For the next ten days the doings at the corner
house and the comings and goings of the
Keiths were a source of entertainment and intense
interest to their neighbors&mdash;the Lightcaps
and others; a fact not to be wondered at when
we consider the monotony of life in the town
at that time;&mdash;no railroad, no telegraph, no
newspaper, except those brought by the weekly
mail; no magazines, no public library, and very
few books in private houses.</p>

<p>Really the daily small occurrences in their own
little world were pretty nearly all the Pleasant
Plainers could find to talk or think about.</p>

<p>And the Keiths, as recent arrivals from an
older settled part of the country, and above
many of them in the social scale, were considered
worthy of more than ordinary attention. Their
dress, their manners, the furnishing of their
house and their style of living were subjects of
eager discussion.</p>

<p>The general opinion among the Lightcaps
and their set seemed to be that they were too
fine for the place; such remarks as the following
being frequently heard,</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why would you believe it, they've got a
real store carpet on that front room, and a sofy
and cheers covered with horse-hair cloth and
white curtains to the winders and picturs hanging
up on to the walls."</p>

<p>"And the little girls wears white pantalets
caliker ones such as our youngsters wears isn't
good enough for them."</p>

<p>There were in the town, however, a number
of families of educated, refined people who rejoiced
in this addition to their society and only
waited for the new comers to get settled in
their new home before calling.</p>

<p>Among these Mrs. Keith and her aunt found
several pleasant, congenial companions; and with
two or three the acquaintance soon ripened into
a close intimacy, a warm, enduring friendship.</p>

<p>Mildred also soon had more than one young
girl crony whom she found as worthy of regard
as those she had left behind.</p>

<p>Back of the yellow house was a grove of
saplings which became a favorite haunt of the
children in their hours of recreation. They
would bend down the smaller trees and ride
them, climb up into the larger and sit among
the branches; or build baby-houses and play
housekeeping underneath, where the shade was
thickest.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>It was here they spent the warm, sunny
days while the older members of the family
busied themselves in making the dwelling habitable
and the yard neat and orderly.</p>

<p>On the morning after their arrival Rupert
spread a buffalo robe on the ground in the
shadiest part of the grove, whereon Zillah and
Ada seated themselves with their baby sister
who had been entrusted to their care.</p>

<p>There were many lovely wild flowers springing
up here and there, and Cyril, Don and Fan
ran hither and thither gathering them, prattling
merrily to each other the while, and now and
then uttering a joyous shout as they came upon
some new floral treasure.</p>

<p>"Be careful not to go too far away, children,"
Zillah called to them.</p>

<p>"No, we won't go far," they answered,
Cyril adding, "And I'll take care of Fan."</p>

<p>In a little while they came running back
with full hands.</p>

<p>"See, see!" they said, "so many and such
pretty ones&mdash;blue, and white, and purple, and
yellow. There, you take these and we'll pick
some more for ourselves. And for mother and
Aunt Wealthy; we'll make a big bunch for
each of them," and away they ran again.</p>

<p>"Oh, aren't they pretty?" cried Ada.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
"Let's make a bouquet for mother out of
these."</p>

<p>"She won't want two," said Zillah, "'specially
just now when she's no place to put
them. Let's make wreaths for Annis and
Fan."</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" and they began sorting the
flowers with eager interest, little Annis pulling
at them too, crowing and chattering in sweet
baby fashion.</p>

<p>Suddenly Zillah gave a start and laid a
trembling hand on Ada's arm. Her face had
grown very pale and there was a look of terror
in her large blue eyes.</p>

<p>Ada turned quickly to see what had caused
it, and was quite as much alarmed on beholding
a tall Indian, with rifle in hand, tomahawk
and scalping knife in his belt, standing within
a few feet of them, evidently regarding them
with curiosity.</p>

<p>He wore moccasins and leggins, and had a
blanket about his shoulders; feathers on his
head, too; but no war paint on his face.</p>

<p>Behind him was a squaw with a great
bark basket full of wild berries, slung to her
back.</p>

<p>The little girls were too terribly frightened
to cry out or speak, they sat there as if turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to stone, while the Indian drew nearer and
nearer still closely followed by his squaw.</p>

<p>Stopping close beside the children, he
grunted out a word or two to her, and she
slung her basket to the ground.</p>

<p>Taking up a double handful of the berries,
he poured them into Zillah's lap, saying, "Pappoose!"</p>

<p>The squaw restored her basket to its place
and the two walked leisurely away; happily
not in the direction of Fan and the boys.</p>

<p>The little girls gazed at each other in blank
astonishment; then burst out simultaneously,
"Oh, weren't you frightened? I thought he
was going to kill us!"</p>

<p>"But wasn't it good in him to give us the
berries?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he meant them for baby; but mother
doesn't let her have any, you know; so we
mustn't give them to her."</p>

<p>"No, but I'll call the children to get some.'</p>

<p>"Yes, do."</p>

<p>"Where did you get em?" queried Cyril,
devouring his share with zest.</p>

<p>"An Indian gave them to us."</p>

<p>"An Indian? why that was like a friend
and colation! I shan't be 'fraid of 'em any
more."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Ada with a wise
shake of her head, "I'd rather not see 'em even
with their berries."</p>

<p>The little feast was just ended when they
espied a gentleman passing along the road beyond
the grove. He turned and came toward
them.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said, pleasantly.
"These are Mr. Keith's children, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Zillah.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," shaking hands with
them; "and I should like to make the acquaintance
of your parents. Are they at home,
in the house yonder?"</p>

<p>"Mother is, sir; but I saw father go away
a little while ago."</p>

<p>"Do you think your mother could see me
for a moment? My name is Lord."</p>

<p>Cyril opened his eyes very wide; gazing up
into the gentleman's face with an odd expression
of mingled curiosity and astonishment.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir;" answered Zillah,
"they're just cleaning the house and&mdash;Cyril,
run and ask mother."</p>

<p>Away flew the child, rushing into the room
where Miss Stanhope and Mrs. Keith were
overseeing the opening of boxes and the unpacking
of the household gear.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother, mother," he cried breathlessly,
"the Lord's out yonder and he wants to see
you! Can he come in? shall I bring him?"</p>

<p>"The Lord! what can the child mean?"
cried Aunt Wealthy, in her astonishment and
perplexity nearly dropping a large china bowl
which she held in her hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith, too, looked bewildered for a
moment, then a sudden light breaking over her
face,</p>

<p>"Yes, bring him in," she said, and turning
to her aunt as the child sped on his errand,
"It must be the minister, auntie; I remember
now that Stuart told me his name was Lord."</p>

<p>Mr. Lord, who was a very absent-minded
man, came in apologizing for his "neglect in
not calling sooner; he had been engaged with
his sermon and the matter had slipped his
mind."</p>

<p>"I think you are blaming yourself undeservedly,
sir," Mrs. Keith said, giving him her
hand with a cordial smile, "we arrived in town
only yesterday. Let me introduce you to my
aunt, Miss Stanhope."</p>

<p>The two shook hands, and Mr. Lord seating
himself upon a box, instead of the chair that
had been set for him, sprang up instantly with
a hurried exclamation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>A portion of the contents of a paper of
tacks had been accidentally spilt there.</p>

<p>The ladies were too polite to smile. Mrs.
Keith offered the chair again, simply saying,
"You will find this a more comfortable seat;
please excuse the disorder we are in;" then
plunged into talk about the town and the little
church he had recently organized there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyril</span> came running back carrying a covered
basket.</p>

<p>"He's gone, girls. He wasn't the Lord at

guess 'cause he sat down on the tacks and
hurted himself.</p>

<p>"Here's our dinner. Mother says we may

<p>"So it will. Let's see what it is," and
Zillah took the basket and lifted the lid. "Oh

and cheese and ginger bread&mdash;lots of it&mdash;and a
turnover apiece."</p>

<p>"Isn't our mother good?" cried Ada gratefully.
"Did you tell her about the Indian
the berries?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and father was there&mdash;he just came
home&mdash;and he says we needn't be a single bit
afraid; they don't kill folks now, and they
wouldn't dare to hurt us right here in the
town; even if they wanted to."</p>

<p>"Baby's been fretting a little; 'cause she's
hungry, I guess," said Zillah, putting a bit of
gingerbread in the little one's hand.</p>

<p>"Yes; mother said you should give her
some cake; and she'll come directly and take
her awhile. Now let's begin to eat, for I'm
as hungry as a big black bear."</p>

<p>"So am I," piped the small voices of Don
and Fan. "But father always asks a blessing
first."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Zillah, stopping short in
her distribution of the good things; "and
mother does it when he's away, but&mdash;" and she
glanced from one to the other of the childish
but grave faces of the little group.</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Cyril, closing his merry
blue eyes and folding his chubby hands. "O
Lord, we thank thee for the ginger bread and
turnovers and&mdash;and all the good things, Amen.
Now gi me mine, Zil," opening his eyes wide
and holding out both hands.</p>

<p>"Ladies first, you know," answered the
sister, "and we must all spread our handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in our laps to keep the greasy crumbs
from our clothes."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I fordot. Help Ada and Fan
and yourself, then Don too, and me last 'cause
we're the gentlemen."</p>

<p>"No, myself last, because that's the way
mother does."</p>

<p>"And mother and father always do everything
right," commented Ada, beginning upon
her sandwich.</p>

<p>They were rosy, healthy children and their
appetites were keen; but they were not selfish
or greedy, and the supply of food was more
than amply sufficient for all.</p>

<p>They were never stinted but had been taught
that waste was sinful; so the remains of the
meal were put carefully by in the basket, which
Zillah then hung up on a branch near at hand.</p>

<p>As she did so the others set up a glad shout,
"Mother's coming!" and sprang forward to
meet her, while baby held out her hands with
a crow of delight.</p>

<p>"Well, dears, had you plenty of dinner?"
Mrs. Keith asked, taking Annis in her arms
and sitting down on the buffalo robe while they
grouped themselves about her.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; yes indeed! some left; and it
was very good. Thank you for it, mother."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"You quite deserved it; you have been
dear, good children, taking care of yourselves
and baby all morning, and not giving any trouble
to anybody."</p>

<p>How the young cheeks flushed and the eyes
grew bright at these words of commendation
from those dear lips. How they loved her for
them, and what an increased desire to merit
her approbation they felt swelling in their
breasts.</p>

<p>She could stay with them only a little while
but suggested various amusements, some games
they might play, some stories Zillah might relate
to the younger ones.</p>

<p>"Are you getting done fast, mother? can
we sleep in our own home to-night?" they
asked.</p>

<p>"No, dears; for though the bedroom floors
are cleaned there might be some dampness that
would injure us. We will go back to the tavern
for our supper and to sleep to-night; but
to-morrow night we will be in our own home
once more."</p>

<p>"Not the nice home we used to have,
though!" sighed Zillah.</p>

<p>"No, daughter; but we must try to be content
and thankful; and if we are, we may be as
happy in the new home as we were in the old."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>With that the now sleeping babe was laid
gently down on the robe, a light covering
thrown over her, and with a charge to the
others to take care of her, and a caress bestowed
upon each, the mother hastened back to the
house.</p>

<p>"We're tired running 'bout and picking
flowers, Fan and Don and me," said Cyril;
"so won't you please tell us a story now,
Zil?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll tell you Androcles and the Lion;
you always like that."</p>

<p>"Yes; and then tell 'bout the girl that had
a silk dress and couldn't run and play 'cause
her shoes pinched," begged Fan.</p>

<p>"Oh look!" exclaimed Ada in an undertone,
"see those girls. They haven't silk
dresses or shoes to pinch their toes. Don't
they look queer?"</p>

<p>The subjects of her remarks were two little
maids&mdash;one about her own size, the other a
trifle smaller&mdash;who were slowly making their
way through the bushes toward the spot where
the Keith children were seated.</p>

<p>They had sallow, sunburnt faces, tawny,
yellow locks straggling over their shoulders,
and their thin, lanky little forms were arrayed
in calico dresses faded, worn and skimpy:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pantalets of the same material but different
color, appeared below their skirts. Their feet
were bare, and on their heads were sunbonnets
of pasteboard covered with still another pattern
of calico both faded and soiled.</p>

<p>"Shall we ask them to come and join us?"
queried Zillah.</p>

<p>"No; they don't look nice; they're dirty,"
whispered Cyril, with a glance of disgust directed
toward the strangers.</p>

<p>"Maybe dey is hungry," suggested Fan,
"let's dive 'em some fing out o' de basket."</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, little girls," said Zillah,
raising her voice slightly as they drew near;
"will you come and sit with us?"</p>

<p>They shook their heads but came creeping
on, each with a finger in her mouth.</p>

<p>"Have you had your dinner?" An affirmative
nod.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell a story to these children,
and if you like to come and listen too, you can.
What are your names?"</p>

<p>"Mine's Emmaretta Lightcap, and hers is
Minerva Lightcap. She's my sister, she is.
Now go on and tell your story. Min, let's set
down on the grass right here."</p>

<p>They listened in open-mouthed wonder till
summoned by a shrill voice from the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of the smithy, when they rose and scampered
away.</p>

<p>The Keiths were a very domestic family;
no place like home to them; and all, from the
father down to little Fan, were heartily weary
of the unsettled life they had led for some
weeks past.</p>

<p>It was therefore with joy they found themselves
once more able to sit down under their
own vine and fig tree, (if a rented domicile so
unsightly as "the yellow house on the corner"
may fitly be compared to natural objects so full
of beauty and grace).</p>

<p>By the evening of the second day the advanced
stage of the internal improvements
warranted them in taking possession.</p>

<p>As the shadows grew long the children were
called in, the family gathered about a neatly
appointed table set out in the centre one of the
three lower rooms; spoken of indifferently as
the sitting, or dining-room, since it must answer
both purposes.</p>

<p>The meal was enlivened by cheerful chat, in
which the children were allowed to take part;
the only restriction being that but one voice was
to be heard at a time; and that not in loud or
boisterous tones.</p>

<p>No domestic had been found yet and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
mother and aunt to chat with the father,
Mildred and the younger girls cleared the table,
washed the dishes and made all neat in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>This done they returned to the sitting-room.
The great family Bible lay open on the table
before the father, a pile of hymn-books beside
it. These last Rupert took up and distributed;
the father read a few verses of Scripture and
gave out a hymn. The mother's sweet voice set
the tune, the others joined in and a full chorus
of praise swelled upon the summer evening air.</p>

<p>It died away, and all knelt while the father
offered a short but fervent prayer giving thanks
for the mercies of the day, asking for protection
through the night, confessing sins and pleading
for pardon and eternal life, for all temporal and
spiritual good, through the atoning blood of
Christ.</p>

<p>It was thus each day was begun and ended
in this truly Christian family. "As for me
and my house we will serve the Lord," was the
resolution with which Mr. and Mrs. Keith had
begun their married life.</p>

<p>Each little one came to claim a good-night
kiss from father and Aunt Wealthy, then cheerfully
followed their mother up the steep
crooked stairway to the large room above.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, how much nicer it looks!" they cried
"Auntie's room too," running to the open door
and peeping in.</p>

<p>Everything was now clean and neat, carpets
covered the rough boards of the floor, curtains
draped the windows and divided the large room
into several apartments, in each of which was a
neat, white bed.</p>

<p>But little of their heavy furniture had been
brought with them from the old home, but its
place was partially supplied by turning packing
boxes into chintz-covered and cushioned lounges,
and toilet tables, whose unsightliness was concealed
by dainty drapery. Ingenuity and taste
had done wonders in making the house comfortable
and attractive at small expense.</p>

<h2>Chapter Ninth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"'Tis necessity,</span><br />
To which the gods must yield."<br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> children had said their prayers, tired
little heads were laid on soft white pillows,
weary young limbs stretched out to rest, and
leaving a kiss on each rosy mouth, the mother
went down stairs to rejoin her husband and
aunt in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>She found Mrs. Prior with them; the good
woman had "just run in" to tell them of a girl
in want of a place.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about her," she
went on, "except, that she's a right decent looking
girl and wants to work out a spell; and that
they tell me the family's English; respectable
but poor.</p>

<p>"If you would wish to give her a trial; Mis'
Keith, I've an opportunity to send her word
this evening and as like as not she'd get a
chance to come in with some of the country
folks to-morrow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Keith gladly gave consent, feeling at
the moment as if almost any sort of help would
be better than none; then asked, "Is there any
school in town that you could recommend for
my little girls, Mrs. Prior?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know of but one and I've
my doubts about that bein' such as you'd want
to send to. Damaris Drybread's the teacher,
and I shouldn't judge by her talk that she'd
had a finished education;&mdash;not by no means!
still she may do well enough for little ones. I
haven't any, you know, so I haven't tried her."</p>

<p>"Suppose we have a light," suggested Mr.
Keith, "it's growing too dark for us to see each
other's faces."</p>

<p>Mildred rose, went to the kitchen, and
presently returned with a lighted candle and a
pair of snuffers, which she placed on the table.</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope was asking what sort of
society was to be found in the place, to which
Mrs. Prior made answer,</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, we have pretty much all
sorts; and yet don't divide up in circles like
they do in a good many places. I s'pose there'll
be more of that as the town grows larger.</p>

<p>"There's educated folks that's fond o' books
and the like, and know what manners is, and
how to talk well, and there's others that's rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and ignorant, yet mostly well meaning with it
all&mdash;real honest and industrious.</p>

<p>"There are very few thieves, if any; folks
leave their doors unlocked&mdash;sometimes wide
open at night, and their clothes hanging out on
the line; and I never hear of anything bein'
took. There's very little drinking either; a
drunken man's a rare sight with us."</p>

<p>"There are a good many New Englanders
here, are there not?" inquired Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a good many; and from York
state and Pennsylvany and Virginia; from
Jersey too; I hail from there myself.</p>

<p>"But I must be going, it's gettin' late;
evenins is so short this time o' year&mdash;and however
it may be with Mr. Keith, I know you
women folks are tired enough to be ready for
bed.</p>

<p>"Now don't be formal with me, but run in
whenever you can. I'll always be glad to see
you.</p>

<p>"No, never mind your hat, Mr. Keith, I
don't want a beau; for I'm not the least mite
afraid. Good-night to you all," and she hurried
away.</p>

<p>The candle was flaring and wasting in the
wind. Miss Stanhope hastened to snuff it, remarking,
"These are miserable tallows; get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
me some candle to-morrow, Stuart, and I'll try
to make some that will be an improvement
upon them. We have the moulds and the
wick; all we want is the tallow."</p>

<p>Near noon of the next day a flauntily dressed
young woman walked in at the open door and
introduced herself to Mrs. Keith as the "Hinglish
girl, Viny Apple, that Mrs. Prior had recommended."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith received her kindly, "Can you
cook and do general housework?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, mum; of course, that's what I came
for."</p>

<p>"I hope you understand how to work, but
it is not to be expected that your way will
always be what will suit me best; so I trust
you are willing to be directed."</p>

<p>"If you're not too hard to please, mum,
I'll suit, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"We will try it. Zillah, show Viny where
she is to sleep."</p>

<p>"Is she to come to the table?" asked Mildred,
when the two had disappeared up the
stairway.</p>

<p>"We shall see; I have not spoken of it
yet."</p>

<p>"You won't put up with that, mother
surely?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I must if that is the only condition
on which we can have help with our housework."</p>

<p>On coming down, Viny was directed to set
the table for dinner, shown where to find the
requisite articles, told how many were in the
family, and left to the performance of her task.</p>

<p>Mildred noted the number of plates set on,
and saw that Viny had counted herself in with
the rest.</p>

<p>"You have one plate too many," she said
with some sharpness of tone.</p>

<p>"No, Miss."</p>

<p>"You certainly have. Here are eleven;
and we are only ten."</p>

<p>"And I make 'leven," returned Viny, a hot
flush on her cheek and an angry gleam in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, I'm as good as the rest; and
if I cook the victuals I 'ave a right to eat
'em."</p>

<p>A warning glance from her mother's eye
checked the angry exclamation on the tip of
Mildred's tongue.</p>

<p>"We will consent to your coming to the
table with us, Viny, on condition that you are
always neat and tidy in appearance," Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Keith remarked in a quiet tone. "And now
you may help me to dish up the dinner."</p>

<p>Aunt Wealthy was busied with her candle
moulds in one corner of the kitchen; putting
in the wicks.</p>

<p>"So that question's settled," she said in
an aside to her niece; "and I think you have
done wisely, Marcia."</p>

<p>The faces that surrounded the dinner-table
that day were a study. Those of Miss Stanhope
and Mrs. Keith wore their usual placid
expression, but Mildred's was flushed and
angry, Rupert's full of astonishment, reflected
to some extent by the younger ones, while that
of the new comer expressed self-assertion and
defiance.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith glanced quizzically from one to
another for a moment. Then gave his attention
to filling the plates; talking at the same
time in a cheerful strain.</p>

<p>"I have found a lot, wife, which I think
will suit us for building on. If nobody feels
too tired for a walk after tea we will all go and
look at it. It is to be for the family, and the
family must decide as to its merits."</p>

<p>This turned the current of thought and all
the young people grew eager and animated.
It was quite evident that no one intended to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
too much fatigued to be of the party of inspection.</p>

<p>In the midst of the talk a low, half-terrified
exclamation from Fan drew the attention of all,
and following the direction of her glance they
saw a tall Indian in the doorway, while beyond
in the street, were many others, some on foot,
some on horseback, some in the act of dismounting.</p>

<p>They were of both sexes and all ages; the
papooses tied into little wooden troughs which
the mothers stood up on end on the ground.</p>

<p>The babies were very quiet, not a whimper
to be heard from any of them; though they
were deprived of the use of their hands&mdash;their
clothing being a straight strip of cloth folded
around their bodies in such a way as to pin
their poor little arms down to their sides&mdash;and
had nothing to amuse them but a string of tiny
bells stretched across the trough in front of their
faces.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said the Indian on the doorstep,
"shawp!" and he pointed from a basket of
berries his squaw had set down beside him to
the loaf on the table.</p>

<p>"Oh do let's give it to 'im! no knowin'
what 'e'll do if we don't!" cried Viny in a
fright.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"It will be a good enough exchange," said
Mr. Keith, taking the loaf and handing it to
the Indian. "Bring a pan for the berries."</p>

<p>The Indian passed the loaf on to his squaw
with a grunt of satisfaction, poured a quart or
so of berries into the pan Viny had hastened to
bring, then again pointed to the table.</p>

<p>"What now?" asked Mr. Keith, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>The Indian replied by a gesture as if lifting
a cup to his lips; and Mildred saying, "He's
thirsty," hastened to pour out a tumbler of milk
and hand it to him.</p>

<p>He drank it, returned the glass with a nod
of thanks and walked away.</p>

<p>"I'll just run hout and water 'em hall," said
Viny, hurrying into the kitchen for a bucket
and tin cup, "it's always best to keep on the
good side of 'em, folks tell me, if you don't want
to run no risk of losin' the 'air hoff yer 'ead."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was standing in the doorway
where the Indian had been a moment before.</p>

<p>"Come and look at them, wife, and all of
you," he said, "it's quite a show and there's
not the least danger."</p>

<p>Thus encouraged the children crowded to
the door and window and found much amusement
in watching the movements of the savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and Viny's efforts to win favor with them; efforts
apparently well-directed, for the day was
warm and they drank the cool water freshly
drawn from the well in the yard, as if they
found it very refreshing.</p>

<p>The troop&mdash;some thirty or forty in number&mdash;did
not tarry long; in less than an hour they
had all remounted and gone on their way.</p>

<p>"There! them savage wild Hinguns is all
clear gone and hour scalps is safe for the present,"
remarked Viny, with a sigh of relief as
the last one disappeared from view in a cloud
of dust far down the street.</p>

<p>She had run out to the corner of the house,
dishtowel in hand, to watch their movements
as far as she could see them.</p>

<p>"Don't talk so; you'll frighten the children,"
said Mildred, reprovingly, speaking from
the front door where she stood with the little
ones grouped about her.</p>

<p>"I don't take my horders from you," muttered
the girl, stalking back to her kitchen.</p>

<p>After an early tea the proposed family walk
was taken.</p>

<p>The lot&mdash;a little farther to the north than
any which had been built upon as yet, on the
high river bank and overlooking the ferry&mdash;was
pronounced all that could be desired.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a corner, and on two sides afforded
a fine view of the river, on the others of town
and country.</p>

<p>"When we have our house built," remarked
Mr. Keith, "we'll be able to see the Kankakee
Marsh from the second story windows."</p>

<p>"Marsh?" repeated his wife in a tone of
alarm, "how far off is it?"</p>

<p>"We're about two miles from this end; it
is two hundred miles long, you remember, extending
far over into Illinois. But why that
sigh?"</p>

<p>"Ague!"</p>

<p>"Well, don't let us cross the bridge before
we come to it. This is a beautiful spot. I
think we can, in a few years, make it superior
in point of beauty to any we have ever lived
in."</p>

<p>"I think so too, if we can keep these fine
old oaks."</p>

<p>There were several of them; grand old
trees that had stood the storms of centuries,
perhaps.</p>

<p>"We will; we'll manage our building in a
way not to interfere with them."</p>

<p>At that Mildred's face brightened as it had
not since her first sight of the yellow house.</p>

<p>She had been very homesick for the dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
old home in Lansdale, though not a word of it
had she breathed even into her mother's sympathetic
ear.</p>

<p>"How soon can the house be done?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Better inquire first how soon it will be
begun," laughed her father. "If we get into it
by next spring we may consider ourselves fortunate."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" sighed the children with one
accord.</p>

<p>"The time will slip around before you know
it, dears," remarked their aunt cheerily.</p>

<p>"And we'll soon get the ground fenced in
and let you spend your leisure time, and exercise
your taste and ingenuity in beautifying it,"
said their father.</p>

<p>"And may we all help plan the house?"
asked Rupert.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith smiled, a kindly good-natured
smile, with some amusement in it too.</p>

<p>"You may all make suggestions; it is to
be our house:&mdash;not the parents' only, but the
children's, too."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Tenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Heaven gives us friends to bless the present scene."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Young.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Rhody Jane, Rhody Jane, I say just
come an' look!"</p>

<p>"Look at what, Emmaret? you're always
makin' a fuss about nothin'," returned Miss
Lightcap scornfully, but nevertheless, stepping
very promptly, plate and dishcloth in hand, to
the front door whence the hasty summons had
come.</p>

<p>"'Tain't nothin' this time," Emmaretta
went on; "they're agoin' to Sunday school,
them Keith girls, and just see how they're
dressed up!"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything so fine?"
chorused Minerva; "sech lovely dresses; and
black silk aprons with colored lace onto 'em.
Oh my! I wish I had one like 'em!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you shall some o' these days when
your pop gits rich," said her mother, who was
gazing from the window.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the bonnets is what takes me. Did
you notice 'em, Rhoda Jane? they're gimp
with blue ribbings and blue flowers."</p>

<p>"And the white and red in their faces makes
them powerful becoming," remarked Gotobed,
standing just outside.</p>

<p>But he turned his head the other way,
shamefacedly, as Mildred, looking sweet and
fair in white muslin and pink ribbons, followed
her younger sisters into the street, and sent a
casual glance in his direction.</p>

<p>"Don't she think she's some!" said Rhoda
Jane enviously.</p>

<p>"And so she is; she looks like a posey,"
said Gotobed.</p>

<p>"Is that the grandmother? the old lady
walking with Mr. Keith."</p>

<p>"No; Viny Apple says she's Mrs. Keith's
aunt; and talks in the funniest way sometimes;&mdash;gets
things hind part before&mdash;telling her to
make up the floors and sweep the beds, and the
like.</p>

<p>"There they're all out o' sight. I guess the
mother's stayin' to home with the baby; Viny
said she wasn't agoin' to, and I s'pose she's up
stairs primpin'."</p>

<p>"And that's what you'd ought to be doin'
'forelong, if you're goin' to meetin', Rhoda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Jane," observed Mrs. Lightcap, drawing in her
head. "Hurry up now with them dishes. And
you children walk right in here and hunt up
your Sunday things, and wash your hands and
faces and comb your hair; it'll be meetin' time
'fore we know it."</p>

<p>A narrow foot-path, bordered on each side
by grass still wet with dew, led past the grove
of saplings to the little church whither the
Keiths were bound.</p>

<p>Mildred, lifting her white skirts daintily,
and warning her sisters and brothers of the
danger of wet and soiled shoes, should they step
aside from the beaten track, picked her way
with careful steps, rejoicing in the fact that the
distance was not great.</p>

<p>The church membership was as yet very
small; Sabbath school ditto. The newly arrived
family made an important addition to the
ranks of both teachers and scholars.</p>

<p>Two Bible classes were organized this morning
and given, respectively, into the charge of
Mr. Keith and Miss Stanhope; Rupert becoming
a member of his father's, Mildred of Aunt
Wealthy's. There were but two others in this
latter class; Claudina Chetwood and Lucilla
Grange; both intelligent, lady-like, refined
girls, who made an agreeable impression upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Miss Stanhope and Mildred also. And this
was mutual.</p>

<p>The morning service followed immediately
upon the close of Sabbath school. The sermon
was excellent; the singing, though not artistic,
and somewhat interrupted by the necessity of
lining out the hymn, on account of the scarcity
of books, earnest and spirited; the people singing,
apparently with the understanding and the
heart also; the prayer was fervent, and the behavior
of the congregation throughout the
whole service was quiet and devotional.</p>

<p>Most of them were town folk, but a few
families had come in from the surrounding
country.</p>

<p>There was little display of fashion or style
in dress; no one was expensively attired; most
of the women and girls wore calico; but all
were neat, some really tasteful; and in intellect
and moral worth, the majority of faces would
have compared favorably with an equal number
in the older States.</p>

<p>People lingered after church for mutual introductions
and the exchange of friendly
remarks and inquiries. The Keiths were
warmly welcomed, assured of intentions to call,
hopes expressed that they would "like the
place," feel quite at home in the church and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
sociable; the country people adding "Come
out and see us whenever you can."</p>

<p>Squire Chetwood and Mr. Keith, who had
made acquaintance during the preceding week,
now introduced their families; each with very
excusable fatherly pride in the good looks and
good manners of his offspring.</p>

<p>The young Chetwoods were nearly as numerous,
as handsome and intelligent as the
Keiths.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall be good friends," said
Claudina, as she and Mildred walked away together.
"Mother was not out to-day because
of a headache; but she and I are coming to see
your mother and you this week."</p>

<p>"We shall be pleased to see you," Mildred
answered heartily, "and I am very glad to accept
your offer of friendship."</p>

<p>They parted at Mr. Keith's door, mutually
pleased, and Mildred carried a brighter face
into the house than she had worn for weeks.</p>

<p>Her mother remarked upon it with delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," she responded gayly, "I
begin to feel a little happier about living here,
now that I find we are to have good preaching,
Sunday school&mdash;with an excellent and competent
teacher for my share"&mdash;glancing archly at
Aunt Wealthy's kindly, sensible face&mdash;"and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pleasant friends;" going on to give a flattering
description of the Chetwoods, particularly
Claudina.</p>

<p>"I hope she will prove a valuable friend
and a very great comfort to you, daughter,"
said Mrs. Keith. "You need young companionship
and I am very glad to know that it
will be provided."</p>

<p>The little girls had been up stairs putting
away their best bonnets.</p>

<p>"Where's Viny?" asked Zillah, running
back into the sitting-room where the older people
still were.</p>

<p>"She went out telling me that she wouldn't
be back till bedtime," replied the mother.</p>

<p>"Leaving us to do our own work!" cried
Mildred. "Oh, mother, what made you let
her?"</p>

<p>"Let her, my child? she did not ask my
permission," laughed Mrs. Keith; "but indeed
I think we are quite as well off without her for
to-day; as we do no cooking on Sunday."</p>

<p>Before another week had passed, Mildred
was ready to subscribe to the opinion that they
were as well without her altogether&mdash;she having
proved herself utterly inefficient, slow and
slovenly about her work, unwilling to be directed,
impertinent, bold and forward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not a day when Mildred's indignation
did not rise to fever heat in view of the
many and aggravated sins of omission and commission
on the part of their "help;" yet it seldom
found vent in words. She was striving
with determined purpose to rule her own
spirit, and asking daily and hourly for strength
for the conflict from Him who has said, "In
me is thine help," "My strength is made perfect
in weakness."</p>

<p>The example set her by her mother and
aunt was also most helpful. They were both
cheerful, patient, sunny-tempered women;
never a word of fretfulness or complaint from
the lips of either; Aunt Wealthy calm and
serene as an unclouded summer day, Mrs. Keith
often bringing to her aid a strong sense of the
ludicrous; turning her vexations into occasions
for jesting and mirth.</p>

<p>Mildred knew that they were trials nevertheless,
and her love and admiration, and her
resolve to show herself worthy to be the daughter
of such a mother, grew apace.</p>

<p>To the affectionate heart of the unselfish
girl there seemed no greater trial than seeing
this dear mother overburdened with care and
toil; but try as she might to take all the burdens
on her young shoulders, it was utterly impossible;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and while the conviction that to see
her impatient and unhappy would add to her
mother's troubles, helped her to maintain her
self-control, the reflection that Viny's shortcomings
added largely to those trials, made it
tenfold more difficult to bear with them.</p>

<p>So also with the little tempers, untidinesses,
and mischievous pranks of her younger brothers
and sisters.</p>

<p>Home, even a happy home, is often a hard-fought
battle-field; and who shall say that there
is not sometimes more true courage displayed
there than in another kind of conflict amid the
roar of cannon and clash of arms, where earthly
glory and renown are to be won.</p>

<p>The Chetwoods and Granges, and several
others of the same standing in society, called
that week; also Mr. Lord, the minister, brought
his old mother who kept house for him, he
being a bachelor.</p>

<p>When Viny happened to be the one to admit
callers, she seemed to think it incumbent
upon her to take a seat in the parlor with them
and exert herself for their entertainment.</p>

<p>Mildred speedily undertook to disabuse her
of this impression, but the girl haughtily informed
her that "she had as good a right in the
parlor as anybody else."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I wouldn't go into it to visit with
anybody that didn't come to see me," said Mildred,
with a determined effort to keep down
her rising anger.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess they're about as likely to
want to see me as any o' the rest; and if they
don't they'd ought to. So there!"</p>

<p>"But you have your work to attend to."</p>

<p>"The work can wait. And the rest o'
you's got plenty to do too."</p>

<p>The only remedy was to keep Viny busy
in the kitchen while some of the family watched
the doors into the streets and admitted visitors.</p>

<p>Even this stratagem sometimes failed and
they could only console themselves that the
visitors understood the situation.</p>

<p>"Ain't you goin' to call on the Keiths?"
asked Gotobed Lightcap at the dinner table one
day about the middle of the week.</p>

<p>"Who? me?" queried his mother; then
pushing away her empty plate, and resting her
elbow on the table, her chin in her hand, while
she looked reflectively off into vacancy. "Well,
I s'pose a body'd ought to be neighborly, and
I'm as willin' to do my part as the next one;
but there's always a sight of work to do at
home; and then I feel kinder backward 'bout
callin' on 'em; they live so fine, you know;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Viny Apple says they use real silver spoons
and eat off real chaney every day; an' that's
more'n we can do when we have company."</p>

<p>"Well, old woman, I guess the victuals
don't taste no better for bein' eat off them
things," responded her husband, cheerfully,
passing his empty cup.</p>

<p>"Maybe. And they don't have no tea nor
coffee for dinner, Viny says. I think it's real
stingy."</p>

<p>"P'raps they don't want it," remarked
Gotobed.</p>

<p>"Don't you b'lieve no such thing!" exclaimed
Rhoda Jane, scornfully, "'tain't fashionable;
and they'd ruther be fashionable than
comfortable. Viny says they're awful stuck
up; wouldn't let her come to the table or into
the parlor if they could help themselves.</p>

<p>"But I don't keer, I'm not afeard on 'em,
if mother is; and I'm goin' over there this
afternoon; if it's only to let 'em see that I feel
myself as good as they be any day; and I'll tell
'em so too, if they don't treat me right."</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Rhoda Jane, how you talk!" said
her mother.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm spunky, mother; that's a fact;
and I ain't a bit ashamed of it nuther."</p>

<p>"Don't you go if you can't behave yourself,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
said Gotobed, leaving the table and the
room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith had gathered her children about
her in the parlor, it being the shadiest and
coolest apartment in the house in the afternoon.
She, herself, Aunt Wealthy and the
little girls were sewing, while Rupert kept the
little boys quiet and interested with the making
of a kite, and Mildred read aloud from Mrs.
Sherwood's "Roxobelle."</p>

<p>Mildred had a clear, sweet-toned voice,
enunciated distinctly, and read with feeling
and expression; so that it was a pleasure to
listen to her.</p>

<p>Rupert, Zillah and Ada were also good readers,
and would take their turns as such; for this
was no new thing, but one of the mother's ways
of educating her children and training them to
a love of literature.</p>

<p>While many another thing had been left behind
in Ohio, they had brought all their books
with them. Poetry, histories, biographies,
books of travel, religious and scientific works,
juvenile story-books and a few novels, all
of the best class, were to be found among
their treasured stores, reveled in by old and
young.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith had his volumes of legal lore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
too, but with these the other members of the
family seldom if ever cared to interfere.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood was a favorite author with
the young people; they were reading "Roxobelle"
for the first time and had reached a most
exciting part&mdash;the scene where the little dog
had led Sophie Beauchamp into the room where
his invalid and much abused mistress lay,
chained by disease to her wretched bed, when
Mrs. Lightcap and Rhoda Jane appeared in the
open doorway.</p>

<p>They were dressed with the utmost simplicity&mdash;gowns,
aprons and sunbonnets of calico,
made without regard to fashion; no collars or
cuffs; hands bare and brown; faces sunburnt,
the mother's stolid, the girl's sufficiently sharp
but lacking education and refinement.</p>

<p>It was far from being a welcome interruption.
Mildred closed her book with a half suppressed
sigh, the little girls exchanged glances
of vexation and disappointment; Rupert, too
scowled and uttered an exclamation of impatience
half under his breath; but Mrs. Keith
and Miss Stanhope rose smilingly, gave the
visitors a cordial greeting, asked them to be
seated and entered into conversation.</p>

<p>"It's powerful warm," remarked Mrs. Lightcap,
accepting the offered chair and wiping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
perspiration from her heated face with the corner
of her apron.</p>

<p>"Yes, it has been an unusually warm day,"
responded Miss Stanhope, handing a fan; while
Mrs. Keith asked if they would not take off
their bonnets.</p>

<p>"Well ma'am, I don't care if I do," returned
Mrs. Lightcap, pulling hers off and laying
it on her lap; Rhoda Jane doing likewise.</p>

<p>"Let me lay them on the table," Mildred
said, recovering her politeness.</p>

<p>"No, thank you; 'tain't worth while fur
the few minutes we're agoin' to set; they's no
ways hefty.</p>

<p>"Our names is Lightcap; this here's my
daughter Rhoda Jane and she says to me,
'mother,' says she, 'we'd ought to be sociable
with them new neighbors of ourn; let's go
over and set a bit.' No, now what am I talkin'
about?' 'twan't her nuther, 'twas Gote that
spoke of it first, but my gal here was more'n
willing to come."</p>

<p>"Yes, we always try to be neighborly," assented
the girl. "How do you like Pleasant
Plains, ladies?"</p>

<p>"It seems a pleasant town and we find
very pleasant people in it," was Mrs. Keith's
smiling rejoinder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the talk!" exclaimed Miss Lightcap
laughing. "You'll do, Mis' Keith."</p>

<p>"Comin' so late you won't be able to raise
no garden sass this year," remarked the mother;
then went on to give a detailed account of what
they had planted, what was growing well, and
what was not, with an occasional digression to
her husband, her cooking and housework, the
occasional attacks of "agur" that interfered
with her plans; and so on and so on&mdash;her
daughter managing to slip in a word or two
now and then.</p>

<p>At length they rose to go.</p>

<p>"How's Viny?" queried Rhoda Jane, addressing
Mildred.</p>

<p>"Quite well, I believe," replied Mildred in
a freezing tone, and drawing herself up with
dignity.</p>

<p>"Tell her we come to see her too," laughed
the girl, as she stepped from the door, "Good-bye.
Hope you won't be ceremonious, but run
in sociable any time o' day."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Eleventh.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Zeal and duty are not slow:</span><br />
But on occasion's forelock watchful wait."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Milton.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> impudent thing!" exclaimed Mildred
to her mother with a flushed and angry
face; "putting us and our maid of all work on
the same level! Visit her? Not I, indeed,
and I do hope, mother, that neither you nor
Aunt Wealthy will ever cross their threshold."</p>

<p>"My dear, she probably did not mean it,"
said Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>"And now let us go on with our story.
You have all waited quietly and politely like
good children."</p>

<p>"Gotobed Lightcap! Lightcap! Gotobed
Nightcap!" sang Cyril, tumbling about on the
carpet. "O Don, don't you wish you had such
a pretty name?"</p>

<p>"No, I wouldna; I just be Don."</p>

<p>"There, dears, don't talk now; sister's going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to read," said their mother. "If you don't
want to be still and listen you may run out
and play in the yard."</p>

<p>"Somebody else tumin'," whispered Fan,
pulling at her mother's skirts.</p>

<p>Mildred closed again the book she had just
resumed, rose and inviting the new comer to
enter, handed her a chair.</p>

<p>She was a tall, gaunt, sallow-complexioned
woman of uncertain age, with yellow hair, pale
watery blue eyes, and a sanctimonious expression
of countenance.</p>

<p>Her dress was almost austere in its simplicity;
a dove-colored calico, cotton gloves of a
little darker shade, a white muslin handkerchief
crossed on her bosom, a close straw bonnet
with no trimming but a skirt of plain, white
ribbon and a piece of the same put straight
across the top, brought down over the ears and
tied under the chin.</p>

<p>"My name is Drybread," she announced
with a slight, stiff courtesy; then seating herself
bolt upright on Mildred's offered chair,
waited to be addressed.</p>

<p>"Mrs. or Miss?" queried Mrs. Keith pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Miss. And yours?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Keith. Allow me to introduce my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
aunt, Miss Stanhope, and my daughter Mildred.
These little people too belong to me."</p>

<p>"Gueth we do so?" said Don, showing a
double row of pearly teeth, "cauth you're our
own mamma. Ain't she, Cyril?"</p>

<p>"Do you go to school, my little man?"
asked the visitor, unbending slightly in the
stiffness of her manner.</p>

<p>"Ain't your man! don't like dwy bwead,
'cept when I'se vewy hungwy."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," chimed in Cyril. "And
we don't go to school. Papa says we're not
big enough."</p>

<p>"Don! Cyril! my little boys must not be
rude," reproved the mamma. "Run away now
to your plays."</p>

<p>"They're pretty children," remarked the
caller as the twain disappeared.</p>

<p>"Very frank in the expression of their
sentiments and wishes," the mother responded
smiling.</p>

<p>"Extremely so, I should say;" added Mildred
dryly.</p>

<p>"Is it not a mother's duty to curb and
restrain?" queried the visitor, fixing her cold
blue eyes upon Mrs. Keith's face.</p>

<p>"Certainly; where she deems it needful."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith's tones were perfectly sweet-tempered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Mildred's not quite so, as she added
with emphasis, "And no one so capable of
judging when it is needful as my mother."</p>

<p>"Quite natural and proper sentiments for
her daughter, no doubt. How do you like
Pleasant Plains?"</p>

<p>The question was addressed more particularly
to Miss Stanhope, and it was she who replied.</p>

<p>"We are quite disposed to like the place
Miss Stalebread; the streets are widely pleasant
and would be quite beautiful if the forest
trees had been left."</p>

<p>"My name is <i>Dry</i>bread! a good honest
name; if not quite so aristocratic and fine
sounding as Keith."</p>

<p>"Excuse me!" said Miss Stanhope. "I
have an unfortunate kind of memory for names
and had no intention of miscalling yours."</p>

<p>"Oh! then it's all right.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Keith, I'm a teacher; take young
boys and girls of all ages. Perhaps you might
feel like entrusting me with some of yours. I
see you have quite a flock."</p>

<p>"I will take it into consideration," Mrs.
Keith answered; "What branches do you
teach?"</p>

<p>"Reading, writing, arithmetic, geography
and English grammar."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've heard of teachers boarding round,"
remarked Mildred, assailed by a secret apprehension;
"is that the way you do?"</p>

<p>"No; I live at home, at my father's."</p>

<p>Miss Drybread was scarcely out of earshot
when Ada burst out vehemently.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be distrusted to her! she
doesn't look distrusty, does she, Zillah? Mother
please don't consider it!"</p>

<p>"But just say yes at once?" asked mother
playfully, pressing a kiss upon the little flushed,
anxious face.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, no! please, mamma dear;"
cried the child returning the caress and putting
her arms lovingly about her mother's neck.
"You didn't like her, did you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith acknowledged laughingly that
she had not been very favorably impressed, and
Zillah joining in Ada's entreaties, presently
promised that she would try to hear their lessons
at home. A decision which was received
with delight and a profusion of thanks and
caresses.</p>

<p>Mildred was glad to find herself alone with
her mother that evening for a short time, after
the younger ones were in bed; for she had a
plan to unfold.</p>

<p>It was that she should act as governess to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
her sisters, and the little boys, if they were considered
old enough now to begin the ascent of
the hill of science.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" the mother said with a
look of proud affection into the glowing animated
face, "I fully appreciate the love and
self-devotion to me and the children that have
prompted this plan of yours; but I am by no
means willing to lay such heavy burdens on
your young shoulders."</p>

<p>"But mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a little, dearie, till I have said my
say. Your own studies must be taken up
again. Your father is greatly pleased with an
arrangement he has just made for you and Rupert
and Zillah to recite to Mr. Lord.</p>

<p>"The English branches, Latin, Greek and
the higher mathematics, are what he is willing
to undertake to teach."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes sparkled. "O mother, how
glad I am! Will he open a school?"</p>

<p>"No; only hear recitations for a couple of
hours every week-day except Saturdays, which
he says he must have unbroken for his pulpit
preparations.</p>

<p>"Your father thinks he is very glad of the
opportunity to add a little to his salary; which,
of course, is quite small."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we study at home? I shall like that.
But he won't take little ones?"</p>

<p>"No; none that are too young to learn
Latin. Your father wants Zillah to begin that
now; and he hopes that a few others will join
the class&mdash;some of the Chetwoods, perhaps."</p>

<p>Mildred's face was all aglow with delight;
for she had a great thirst for knowledge, and
there had seemed small hope of satisfying it in
this little frontier town where the means for
acquiring a liberal education were so scant and
poor.</p>

<p>"So you see, daughter, you will have no
lack of employment," Mrs. Keith went on;
"especially as with such inefficient help in the
kitchen and with general housework, I shall
often be compelled to call upon you; or rather,"
she added, with a slight caress, "to accept the
assistance you are only too ready to give."</p>

<p>"It is too bad!" cried the girl, indignantly;
"that Viny doesn't earn her salt! I wonder
how you can have patience with her, mother,
if I were her mistress I'd have sent her off at a
moment's warning long before this."</p>

<p>"Let us try to imitate God's patience with
us, which is infinite;" Mrs. Keith answered low
and reverently; "let us bear with her a little
longer. But indeed, I do not know that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
could fill her place with any one who would
be more competent or satisfactory in any way."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is quite true; but it does
seem too hard that such a woman as my gifted,
intellectual, accomplished mother should have
to spend her life in the drudgery of housework,
cooking, mending and taking care of babies."</p>

<p>"No, dear; you are taking a wrong view of
it. God appoints our lot; he chooses all our
changes for us; Jesus, the God-man, dignified
manual labor by making it his own employment
during a great part of his life on earth;
and 'it is enough for the disciple that he be as
his Master, and the servant as his Lord.'</p>

<p>"Besides, what sweeter work can a mother
have than the care and training of her own offspring?"</p>

<p>"But then the cooking, mother, and all the
rest of it!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, the health, and consequently
the happiness and usefulness of my husband
and children, depend very largely upon the
proper preparation of their food; so that is no
mean task."</p>

<p>"Ah, mother, you are determined to make
out a good case and not to believe yourself
hardly used," said Mildred, smiling, yet speaking
in a half petulant tone.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I am not hardly used; my life is
crowned with mercies, of the very least of which
I am utterly unworthy," her mother answered,
gently.</p>

<p>"And, my child, I find that any work is
sweet when done 'heartily as to the Lord and
not unto men!' What sweeter than a service
of love! 'Be ye followers of God as dear children.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aunt Wealthy, coming in at
the moment; "'as dear children,' not as servants
or slaves, but doing the will of God from
the heart; not that we may be saved, but because
we are saved; our obedience not the
ground of our acceptance; but the proof of our
love to Him, our faith in Him who freely gives
us the redemption purchased for us by His own
blood. Oh what a blessed religion it is! how
sweet to belong to Jesus and to owe everything
to him!"</p>

<p>"I feel it so," Mrs. Keith said, with an undertone
of deep joy in her sweet voice.</p>

<p>"And I," whispered Mildred, laying her
head in her mother's lap as she knelt at her
side, as had been her wont in childish days.</p>

<p>They were all silent after that for many
minutes, sitting there in the gloaming; Mrs.
Keith's hand passing softly, caressingly over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
her daughter's hair and cheeks; then Mildred
spoke.</p>

<p>"Let me try it, mother dear; teaching the
children, I mean. You know there is nothing
helps one more to be thorough; and I want to
fit myself for teaching if ever I should have my
own living to earn."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my child, you may try."</p>

<p>"That's my own dear mother!" exclaimed
the girl joyfully, starting up to catch and kiss
the hand that had been caressing her. "Now,
I must arrange my plans. I shall have to be
very systematic in order to do all I wish."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Stanhope, "one can accomplish
very little without system, but often
a great deal with it."</p>

<p>Mildred set to work with cheerfulness and
a great deal of energy and determination, and
showed herself not easily conquered by difficulties;
the rest of that week was given to planning
and preparing for her work, and on the following
Monday her long neglected studies were resumed
and her duties as family governess entered
upon.</p>

<p>These took up the morning from nine to
twelve, but by early rising and diligence she
was able to do a good deal about the house before
the hour for lessons to begin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Her mother insisted that she must have an
hour for recreation every afternoon, taking a
walk when the weather permitted; then another
for study, and the two with Mr. Lord left but a
small margin for anything else; the sewing
and reading with mother and sisters usually
filled out the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Sometimes her plans worked well and she
was able to go through the round of self-imposed
duties with satisfaction to herself and to
that of her mother and aunt, who looked on with
great interest and were ever on the watch to
lend a helping hand and keep hindrances out
of her way.</p>

<p>But these last would come now and again,
in the shape of callers, accidents, mischievous
pranks on the part of the little ones or delinquencies
on that of the maid of all work, till at
times Mildred's patience and determination
were sorely tried.</p>

<p>She would grow discouraged, be nearly ready
to give up, then summon all her energies to
the task, battle with her difficulties and for a
time rise superior to them.</p>

<p>But a new foe appeared upon the field and
vanquished her. It was the ague, attacking
now one, and now another of the family; soon
they were seldom all well and it was no uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thing for two or three to be down with
it at once. Viny took it and left, and they
hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry.</p>

<p>Governessing had to be given up, nursing
and housework substituted for that and for
sewing and reading, while still for some weeks
longer the lessons with Mr. Lord were kept up;
but at length they also had to be dropped, for
Mildred herself succumbed to the malaria and
grew too weak, ill and depressed for study.</p>

<h2>Chapter Twelfth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"We're not ourselves,</span><br />
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind<br />
To suffer with the body."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shaks. King Lear.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> neighbors were very kind; coming in
with offers of assistance in nursing the sick,
bringing dainties to tempt their appetites, encouraging
them with the assurance that they
were but sharing the common lot; "almost
everybody expected a chill about once in two
or three weeks; especially this time of year;
and they weren't often disappointed, and
thought themselves fortunate if they could stop
at one paroxysm till the week came round again.</p>

<p>"Quinine would generally stop it, and when
people had a long siege of the ague, they often
got used to it so far as to manage to keep up
and about their work; if not at all times at
least between the chills, which as a general
thing came only every other day.</p>

<p>"Indeed it was no unusual thing for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to feel quite bright and well on the intermediate
day."</p>

<p>The Lightcaps were not a whit behind the
others in these little acts of kindness. Rhoda
Jane forgot her envy of Mildred on learning
that she was sick and seemed to have lost her
relish for food.</p>

<p>One morning Miss Stanhope, who was getting
breakfast, was favored with an early call
from Miss Lightcap.</p>

<p>She appeared at the open kitchen door
basket in hand, and marched in without stopping
to knock. "I heerd Miss Mildred was
sick and couldn't eat nothin'," she said; "and
I knowed you hadn't no garden sass o' your
own; so I fetched over some tomats; we have
a lot this year, real splendid big ones, and there
ain't nothin' tastes better when you're gettin'
over the agur, than tomats.</p>

<p>"Just you cut 'em up with vinegar and
pepper and salt, and if she don't say they're
first-rate eatin'&mdash;I'm mistaken; that's all."</p>

<p>"Thank you, you're very kind, Miss Nightcap,"
said Aunt Wealthy, looking so pleased
and grateful that the girl could not take the
misnomer as an intentional insult.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" she said, "it's nothin'; we've
plenty of 'em."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Having emptied her basket upon the table,
she was starting for the door, but looked back.</p>

<p>"Say, do you want a girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, if we can get one that's
worth anything."</p>

<p>"Well, Celestia Ann Hunsinger told me
she wouldn't mind coming here for a spell;
'cause she wants money to git new clo'es."</p>

<p>"What sort of a girl is she?"</p>

<p>"Pretty high-strung and spunky, but some
punkuns for work."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'll tell Mrs. Keith about it,
and send you word directly after breakfast."</p>

<p>"All right. I guess she'll come if you
want her."</p>

<p>She was scarcely gone when the door at the
foot of the stairs opened, and Mildred's pale
face appeared.</p>

<p>"Aunt Wealthy, it is too bad to see you at
work here. Let me get breakfast. I do think
I can. The children are dressing each other,
mother has the baby and won't let me do anything
up there."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not find me a whit more
tractable," returned Miss Stanhope. "Let you
get breakfast, indeed! I'd be worse than a
brute if I did.</p>

<p>"Go into the sitting-room and lie down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the lounge," she continued taking up one of
the finest tomatoes and beginning to divest it
of its skin, "and I'll bring you something presently
that I really hope will taste good to you.</p>

<p>"That Miss Heavycap brought you a present.
She's not over refined, but good-hearted,
I think, in spite of her rude ways and rough
talk."</p>

<p>"Yes, they have been very kind and neighborly;
I wish they were the sort of people one
could enjoy being intimate with," Mildred
said, languidly. "Auntie, let me skin those
tomatoes."</p>

<p>"Child, you look ready to drop."</p>

<p>"Do I?" smiling faintly, "well, I'll sit
down to it. I really can't let you do everything.
How fine and large these are; are they
what Rhoda Jane brought?"</p>

<p>"Yes; for your breakfast. I hope you'll
relish them; and the corn-pone I have in the
oven, too."</p>

<p>"See here! haven't I learned how?" cried
Rupert exultingly, stepping in at the open
door and holding up a foaming bucket of milk
"Viny never persuaded old Suky to give us so
much."</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," said Aunt Wealthy, taking
it from him with a congratulatory smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>.
"I'll strain it at once before the cream begins
to rise."</p>

<p>"I'll carry the pans down cellar. And what
more can I do, auntie?"</p>

<p>"You may draw the butter up out of the
well, presently, when breakfast is quite ready."</p>

<p>"And let it down again when the meal's
over. Hello, Milly! is that you? how white
and weak you look!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, laying the last tomato in
the dish, "I believe I'll have to lie down, as
Aunt Wealthy bade me, till breakfast is ready."</p>

<p>She tottered into the sitting-room and laid
herself down on the lounge feeling so miserably
weak and forlorn, so homesick for the old home
where they had all enjoyed good health, that
the tears would come in spite of every effort to
restrain them.</p>

<p>Breakfast was to be eaten here; the table
was already set, neatly, too, with snowy cloth,
shining silver and delicate china; but there was
a look of discomfort about the room that vexed
and tried her orderly soul; sand on the carpet,
dust on the furniture, children's toys and a few
articles of clothing scattered here and there&mdash;and
she had no strength to rise and put it in
order.</p>

<p>"And no one else is much better able," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sighed to herself, "for Aunt Wealthy, mother
and Zillah have all had chills within a week.
Oh dear, this dreadful country! why did we
ever come to it!"</p>

<p>She heard her father's voice in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Here, Aunt Wealthy, is some steak; rather
better than usual, I think; can we have a bit
broiled for breakfast?" and Miss Stanhope's
cheery tones in reply,</p>

<p>"Yes, Stuart, I'll put it right on. I'm so
glad you succeeded in getting some fresh meat.
It's something of a rarity to us in these days,
and I hope they'll all relish it, Marcia and
Milly, especially; for they both need something
to build up their strength."</p>

<p>"Where are they? not able to be up?"</p>

<p>His tone was anxious and concerned.</p>

<p>Mildred did not catch the words of Miss
Stanhope's reply, but the door opened, her father
came to her side, stooped over her and
kissed her pale cheek tenderly.</p>

<p>"How are you, daughter? Don't be discouraged;
we'll have you all right before long."</p>

<p>"O father, I'm so out of heart," she sobbed,
raising herself to put her arms round his neck
and lay her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, that won't do! you must be brave
and hopeful," he said, stroking her hair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
"You're not so very ill, my child; ague is not
a dangerous disease."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, but there's so much to be
done and nobody to do it; we're all so poorly."</p>

<p>"Don't fret about the work; we'll find
some one to do it."</p>

<p>"But they don't do it right. Viny never
would spread up a bed straight or sweep or
dust without leaving half the dirt behind her.
And when she washed she faded the calicoes,
shrank the flannels and made the white clothes
a wretched color, though she tore them to
pieces with hard rubbing and wringing."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have just to try not to mind
these trifles or be too particular," he said, soothingly.
"Ah, here comes the breakfast," as
Miss Stanhope, Rupert, Zillah and Ada trooped
in, each bearing a dish, "let me help you to the
table."</p>

<p>"I don't feel in the least hungry," she objected.</p>

<p>"Then eat to please father."</p>

<p>"And mother too," said Mrs. Keith coming
in with Baby Annis in her arms. "Come,
daughter, dear, auntie has prepared an excellent
meal for us. With some help from our kind
neighbors too, I hear."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Miss Stanhope, "and I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
directed them according to preparations and
they do taste good. Come now; when I see
you eating, I'll tell you a bit of news the girl
brought besides."</p>

<p>Mildred laughed, felt her spirits begin to
rise, tasted the tomatoes, pronounced them excellent
and went on to make a good hearty
meal.</p>

<p>The world looked brighter after that.</p>

<p>It had been decided to try Miss Hunsinger
if she could be got. Mr. Keith went in search
of her shortly after breakfast, and within an
hour she was duly installed into office.</p>

<p>She was a tall, strong woman with a large
proportion of bone and muscle; ditto of self-conceit
and impudence united to uncommon
energy and decision, and a faculty of turning off
a great amount of work; doing it thoroughly
well too.</p>

<p>At first she seemed a great improvement
upon Viny, and Mildred's heart rejoiced in a
complete sweeping, dusting and setting to rights
of the whole house.</p>

<p>The children had been sent out to play in
the shade of the sapling grove, while Mrs. Keith
superintended the operations of the new help,
and Miss Stanhope and Mildred, in the parlor,
busied themselves, the one with the week's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
mending for the family, the other over her
sometime neglected studies.</p>

<p>"She's a real new broom&mdash;is my Celestia
Ann," said Mrs. Keith, coming cheerily in,
"leaves no dirty corners or cobwebs, no wrinkles
in sheets or spreads."</p>

<p>"O, mother, what a blessing?" cried Mildred,
"if she'll only stay so."</p>

<p>"Ah, there's the rub! she cannot be a rose
without a thorn. What was it Rhoda Jane
said of her, Aunt Wealthy?"</p>

<p>The old lady reflected a moment ere she
answered.</p>

<p>"Large potatoes, I think it was, Marcia;
and I understood it to mean that she was a good
worker. Something also that gave me the impression
that she might be high-tempered and
saucy. But as you say, we cannot expect
thorns without roses."</p>

<p>"She's getting dinner now," remarked Mrs.
Keith, "and seems to feel as much at home
there as about her other work. I've told her
what to get, and showed her where everything
is; and now I shall leave her to her own devices;
and see what will be the result."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the door of the parlor,
where now the whole family were gathered, was
thrown open with the announcement,</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dinner's ready; all on the table here."</p>

<p>Having given the summons Miss Hunsinger
rushed back to the table in advance of the
family, seated herself, spread out her elbows
upon it and with a nonchalant air said, "Come,
folks, it's all ready; set right up."</p>

<p>There was a rapid exchange of glances
among the party addressed, but not a word of
remonstrance or disapproval was uttered.
Physically unequal to the work that must be
done, they were helpless in the hands of their
"help."</p>

<p>The meal was begun in a profound silence
which she was the first to break.</p>

<p>"Ther's some hot biscuits out thar," with a
jerk of the head toward the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"You may bring some in," said Mrs.
Keith.</p>

<p>"Just let one o' your gals do it this time, I
will next. Turn about fair play you know."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes flashed, and she opened her
lips to speak; then closed them firmly as she
thought of the consequences to her mother and
aunt should this girl be sent away before she
was able to take up even a part of the burden
of the work.</p>

<p>"I'll go, mother," said Zillah, hastily leaving
her place, "I don't mind it; but if I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
paid for doing it, I would want to earn my
money by doing it myself."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what do you think of your
new help?" queried Mr. Keith, mischievously
when they had withdrawn to the privacy of
the parlor.</p>

<p>"The thorn is rather large and sharp," she
answered laughing, "but we are not the only
people in the world who must make a choice of
evils."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Mildred severely, "I
think it's a species of dishonesty to take pay for
doing the work of a family and then ask them
to do it themselves."</p>

<p>"Aren't you a trifle too hard on her, dear?"
said Miss Stanhope. "It was very forward and
impertinent, but I think hardly dishonest, because
she is not expected to do quite all the
work of the family."</p>

<p>"Here comes Emmaretta Lightcap," said
Ada, who was standing in the open doorway.
"She has an old faded calico dress, and
sunbonnet and bare feet, just as usual; and a
tin pan in her hands."</p>

<p>"Come in, Emmaretta."</p>

<p>The little girl stepped over the threshold
and approaching Mrs. Keith said,</p>

<p>"Here's more tomats mother sent you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and a bird for her," pointing to Mildred,
"Gote he's been out shootin' and he sent it to
her."</p>

<p>"He's very kind, take him my thanks for
it," said Mildred, coloring, and vexed with herself
for doing so. "Please tell your sister, too,
that I thank her for the tomatoes and that I
liked them very much."</p>

<p>"Are you a comin' to our school? cause
Miss Damaris, she said you was," said the child,
turning to Ada, while waiting for her pan,
which Zillah had carried away to empty it.</p>

<p>"No! no, indeed!" cried Ada; "I don't
like her, and wouldn't go there for anything!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, Ada! you don't know Miss
Drybread," said Mrs. Keith, quite surprised at
the outbreak.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; don't you remember she
was here one day?"</p>

<p>"Rhoda Jane, she's comin' over to see you
this evenin'," said the little maid, taking her
pan and departing.</p>

<p>Mildred's countenance fell; she appreciated
Rhoda Jane's kindness; but could not enjoy
her society.</p>

<p>"Why, Ada," said Mr. Keith, "I knew
nothing of your dislike to Miss Drybread; and
so when she met me in the street this morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and asked me to send her a scholar, I thought
of Milly's sickness and that she must not
have so much to do, and promised that you
should go."</p>

<p>"O father!" exclaimed the child beginning
to cry.</p>

<p>Then they all tried to comfort her, and
finally she grew in a measure reconciled to her
fate.</p>

<h2>Chapter Thirteenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Go just alike, yet each believes his own."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pope.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> hain't returned more'n our fust call;
and then you didn't stay but ten minutes,"
Rhoda Jane said in a half-offended tone, to
Mildred, "And we're such near neighbors too;
we'd ought to be real sociable."</p>

<p>Mildred apologized by stating the fact that
her time was very fully occupied.</p>

<p>"Well you and Claudina Chetwood seems
to be pretty thick. But the Chetwoods is
richer'n we are, an' I s'pose that makes it easier
to find time to visit with 'em."</p>

<p>"The riches don't make any difference,"
said Mildred, flushing; "and I've heard that
the Chetwoods are not very rich."</p>

<p>"Well, they hold their heads high anyway.</p>

<p>"I'm agoin' to have a rag carpet party
pretty soon, and give you an invite, and if you
don't come I'll be so mad I won't never come
near you again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I may be sick," sighed Mildred,
half hoping in her secret heart that so it might
fall out.</p>

<p>"Oh, then of course I couldn't be mad; but
I'll try to fix it when you're well."</p>

<p>"When is it to be? and what is it like?"</p>

<p>"Soon's mother and me gits the rags all
cut; 'bout a week from now, I reckon. Why
a passel o' girls gits together and sews the rags
and winds 'em up into balls, and after awhile the
boys come in and then we have lots o' fun and
good things to eat. Now I must run home.
Good-bye, mind you're to be sure to come."</p>

<p>This was Friday. On the ensuing Monday
morning little Ada set out sorrowfully for Miss
Drybread's school, in company with Emmaretta
and Minerva Lightcap.</p>

<p>Mildred was alone in the parlor when the
child came back at noon.</p>

<p>"Well, pussy, how did you like it?" she
asked with a sympathetic smile.</p>

<p>"Not at all. O Mildred, she isn't a lady
or a Christian; for she deceives; she acts lies;
she made a naughty girl believe she was going
to roast her to death. There's a stove and a
big oven in it; and she said she was going to
put her in there and build up a hot fire and
cook her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the girl believe it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was dreadfully frightened; she
screamed like everything and promised that
indeed, and indeed she'd be good; and Miss
Drybread let her go to her seat."</p>

<p>"That was acting a lie and telling one too;
and anybody who would do so, is unfit to have
the care of children," said Mildred. "I shall
tell father and mother about it, and I'm very
sure they won't send you any longer than this
one quarter anyhow."</p>

<p>"Mildred, she doesn't look like a lady
either; she doesn't wear anything white round
her neck; just a pink calico cape and an apron
of the same, and another kind of calico dress."</p>

<p>"No matter about that if she only acted
and talked right. She's neat and clean, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I didn't see any soil on her clothes."</p>

<p>"Well, learn your lessons well and behave
nicely, so that she can't find any excuse for ill
treating you."</p>

<p>Mildred looked upon the expected carpet
rag party with nearly as great aversion as Ada
felt for her new school, but was a good deal
relieved on learning from Claudina Chetwood
that she, too, had been notified of its approach
and expected to attend.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't know that you visited the Lightcaps,"
said Mildred.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; they are not cultivated people,
or very refined; but they're clever folks and
kind neighbors; especially in times of sickness;
and would feel dreadfully hurt if one should
decline their invitations. They're not the sort
of people we exchange formal calls with; indeed
they never make them; but, as mother
says, while society here is in the crude state
it is now, it will not do to insist upon making
associates of those only who are congenial."</p>

<p>"Or quite belong to our station in life?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we can not divide up into many circles,
and must be willing to mix to some extent,
with all who can lay claim to respectability
and moral worth."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm very proud," said Mildred
laughing and blushing. "I've never been used
to associating with any one so rough and
uncouth, and it goes a good deal against the
grain."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it isn't exactly pride," suggested
Claudina; "they offend your taste; they do
mine, I know; but surely we can bear that
rather than give them the pain of thinking that
we despise them."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," assented Mildred heartily;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and from that moment ceased to allow herself
to hope that something would occur to give
her a plausible excuse for staying away from
Rhoda Jane's merry-making.</p>

<p>She repeated Claudina's remarks to her
mother and aunt and found that they fully approved
of the sentiments she had expressed.</p>

<p>"Time was when I should have been very
unwilling to see you consort with that class on
terms of equality," said Mrs. Keith, "but circumstances
alter cases."</p>

<p>The invitation came for Friday afternoon
and evening; Rhoda Jane hailing Rupert as
he passed and sending it through him.</p>

<p>Mildred was nearly in her usual health and
accepted without a demur; but puzzled to
know what to wear, and at what hour to go,
went to Claudina for instruction on these important
points.</p>

<p>"We are invited to work, you know," said
Miss Chetwood, laughing, "so will be expected
early; we should not be later than one o'clock,
I think, and as it is not very nice work&mdash;carpet
rags being apt to be dusty&mdash;we should not
wear anything that will not wash. I shall put
on a calico dress and carry a big work apron
with me."</p>

<p>"Then I shall do the same."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would; for there will be some
girls there who haven't the means to dress and
would feel badly if you or I outshone them very
much."</p>

<p>"I can't go before three, or half-past,
though; on account of having to recite to Mr.
Lord."</p>

<p>"Never mind; I daresay it's just as well;
for you'll get quite enough of both the work
and the company."</p>

<p>Following out the instructions received,
Mildred attired herself for the occasion with
the utmost simplicity; but could not lay aside
her delicate prettiness or a certain air of culture
and refinement that made her more the real
lady in her calico, than almost any of her companions
of the afternoon would have been in
the richest silk or velvet.</p>

<p>Just as she was ready to go, Ada came in
from school, crying heartily.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mildred, meeting
her on the threshold and turning back full
of sympathy.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I've lost my place in the spelling-class,"
sobbed the child, "and I didn't miss a word
either. You know I got up head the first day, and
I've kept there ever since&mdash;'way above all those
big, big girls, some of 'em as big as you, Milly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how did you get down if you didn't
miss? was it for bad behavior?"</p>

<p>"No; but she upset the class and made us
all draw lots for our places, and the one I drew
made my place next to the foot."</p>

<p>"Mother, do you hear that?" asked Mildred,
hotly; for anything like abuse or unjust
treatment of her little brothers or sisters was
sure to rouse her ire.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mrs. Keith said, "but Ada, you like
the fun of getting up in your class, and you
could never have that if you were always at the
head."</p>

<p>This seemed a new idea to the child, and
she smiled faintly through her tears.</p>

<p>But the wound was so deep it must bleed
awhile, and the briny drops fell fast again.</p>

<p>She was an uncommonly good speller for a
child of her age, and had taken great pride in
keeping her place, working very hard to be able
to do so; and this sudden, unexpected downfall,
due to no failure on her part, almost overwhelmed
her with a sense of loss, humiliation
and injustice.</p>

<p>Mildred waited; she couldn't bear to go
and leave Ada in such distress.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," she said, stroking her hair
caressingly while the mother wiped away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fast flowing tears with her own soft white handkerchief,
and kissed the flushed cheek, "don't
cry, you'll soon get up again."</p>

<p>"And I shall write a note to Miss Drybread,
telling her that I cannot approve of
drawing lots to decide so trivial a matter;" said
Mrs. Keith. "It seems to me very wrong;
because it is an appeal to God. 'The lot is
cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
is of the Lord!' It might be well enough to
turn the class round occasionally, or in some
other way to give the poor scholars a chance to
rise; but this proceeding I so highly disapprove
of that I shall not allow you to take part in it
again."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd take me away out of her
school, mother, oh do," pleaded the little girl.</p>

<p>"You shall not be kept there long," Mrs.
Keith said. "But Mildred, child," she added
gayly, "you must hurry away or I fear you'll
not earn your supper."</p>

<p>A dozen maidens, mostly under twenty years
of age, were collected in "the front room" at
Mr. Lightcap's. A large clothes basket filled
with many colored rags, torn or cut into strips
of various lengths, occupied a conspicuous place
upon the floor.</p>

<p>A number of girls were grouped about it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and armed with needles and thread, scissors and
thimbles, were busily engaged picking out the
strips, sewing the ends together and winding the
long strings thus formed, into balls; others had
filled their laps and seated themselves here and
there about the room.</p>

<p>They seemed a very merry company, laughing
and chatting as they worked.</p>

<p>"Oh, how d'ye do?" said Rhoda Jane,
catching sight of Mildred as she drew near
the door, which was standing open; "thought
you wasn't comin' at all. Walk right in. Let
me take your sunbonnet. Here's a seat for
you 'long side of Miss Chetwood. Guess you're
better acquainted with her than any body else,
without it's Viny Apple.</p>

<p>"Ladies, this is Miss Keith."</p>

<p>"I don't need no hintroduction," laughed
Miss Apple. "'Ope you're well, Miss Milly."</p>

<p>The others looked up with a nod and a
murmured word or two, as Rhoda Jane named
each in turn; then they seemed to take up the
thread of their discourse where it had been
dropped, while Mildred tied on her apron, took
the chair assigned her, threaded a needle, and
helping herself, by invitation, from Claudina's
lap, began her first ball, at the same time explaining
that her lessons had detained her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must be goin' to be dreadful learned,"
commented Rhoda Jane, filling Mildred's lap
from the basket, "I wouldn't be you for something.
I hate books and always did."</p>

<p>"Are we all here now?" asked some one.</p>

<p>"All but Damaris Drybread. She's oldish
for the rest of us, but she's the schoolma'am,
you know, and likes to be invited. And though
she's late comin'&mdash;yonder she is now&mdash;she
works dreadful fast when she does get at it."</p>

<p>Mildred overheard a whisper not complimentary
to the coming woman,</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I wish she hadn't been asked.
She spoils everything; for she's as solemn as a
funeral and 'pears to think it's a sin to laugh."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented another voice, "that's so!
and she never forgets that she's a schoolma'am;
but takes it upon herself to tell you your duty
without waiting to be invited to."</p>

<p>But now Miss Drybread was upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>"Good evening," she said, in solemn tone
and with a stiff little bow, addressing her salutation
to the company in general; then giving
her sunbonnet to Rhoda Jane, she seated herself
in her usual bolt upright manner and fell
to work.</p>

<p>Her presence acted as a damper upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
spirits of the younger portion of the party. A
dead silence succeeded the merry chatter and
laughter of a moment before.</p>

<p>Mildred had cared little for that while it
went on, but it vexed her now that this woman,
for whom, principally on Ada's account, she
began to feel a decided dislike, should have it in
her power thus to spoil the enjoyment of others;
and she determined that it should not be.</p>

<p>Raising her voice that all might hear, she
told an amusing anecdote that set everybody
to laughing except the "schoolma'am," whose
increasing solemnity of aspect seemed to reprove
their levity.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was first-rate! do tell us another,"
cried Rhoda Jane, holding her sides. "I had
no idea you could be so funny."</p>

<p>Mildred went on with anecdotes, jests,
conundrums, Claudina and one or two others
contributing their quota also, till with the ruder
ones the mirth became somewhat boisterous.</p>

<p>As it died down again, Miss Drybread
spoke.</p>

<p>"Life, permit me to observe to you all, is
too serious and solemn to be spent in laughing
and joking. Allow me to say, Miss Keith,
that I am astonished that you, a church member,
should indulge in such frivolity."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think a Christian should always
wear a long face, ma'am?" asked Mildred,
saucily, her tell-tale countenance showing all
too plainly the contempt and aversion she felt
for her self-constituted censor.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think that folks that profess that
they've got religion ought to be grave and
sober, and let the world see that they don't belong
to it."</p>

<p>"As if there was any harm in innocent
mirth!" exclaimed Mildred, "as if there was
anybody in the world with so good a right to
be glad and happy as one who knows that Jesus
loves him! 'Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous
and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart,'
The Bible is full of commands to God's people
to rejoice, to be glad, to sing for joy; and the
best Christians I know seem to me the happiest
people on earth."</p>

<p>"You're rather young to set up your judgment
as to who's the best Christian and who's
got religion and who hasn't," returned the
spinster bridling.</p>

<p>"Well, none o' your long-faced, sour-looking
Christians for me!" exclaimed Rhoda Jane,
"I'd never want to get religion till the last
minute, if I wasn't to be 'lowed to laugh and
joke no more."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can not read the heart, nor can any
other human creature," said Mildred, replying
to Miss Drybread's last remark; "but Jesus
says, 'By their fruits ye shall know them.'
'He that keepeth my commandments he it is
that loveth me;' and when you live with people
and see them constantly serving God with
gladness, walking in his ways, rejoicing in his
love, making the Bible always their rule of
faith and practice, showing far more solicitude
about heavenly than about earthly things, both
for themselves and their children, I think you
may be very sure they are real Christians."</p>

<p>"I think so too!" said Claudina emphatically.</p>

<p>"So do I," "and I," chimed in several
other voices, "but do you know any such
folks?"</p>

<p>"I have been describing my father and
mother," Mildred said. "And my dear Aunt
Wealthy too."</p>

<p>"That's a fact," spoke up Viny. "You
'ave to live with folks to find 'em out, and I've
lived there and I never seen better Christians;
they don't keep their religion for Sundays, but
Mr. Keith 'e reads in the good book hevery
night and mornin' and prays just like a minister&mdash;honly
not so long&mdash;and they sing 'ymns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
And I never 'eard a cross word pass between
Mr. and Mrs. Keith&mdash;or Mrs. Stan'ope heither,
and they never threaten the children they'll
do something hawful like breakin' their bones
or skinnin' of 'em alive, has some folks does; but
just speaks to 'em quiet like, sayin' exactly what
they mean: and they're always minded too."</p>

<h2>Chapter Fourteenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Jest and youthful jollity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Quips and cranks and wanton wiles,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nods and becks and wreathed smiles."</span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">There</span> had better be less talk, if these
rags are all to be sewed to-day," remarked Miss
Drybread, taking a fresh supply from the basket,
then straightening herself till she was, if
possible, more erect than before.</p>

<p>"I can talk and work too; my needle haint
stopped because my tongue was runnin'," retorted
Viny; "and it strikes me you've been
doin' your share as well's the rest."</p>

<p>"My second ball's done," said Claudina,
tossing it up.</p>

<p>"A good big one too, and wound real
tight," said Rhoda Jane taking it, giving it a
squeeze, then rolling it into a corner where
quite a pile had collected.</p>

<p>"How quick you are, Claudina," said Mildred.</p>

<p>"Not so very; I've been at it quite a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
while. Some folks can pretty nearly make two
to my one." And she glanced toward Miss Drybread
who was just beginning to wind her
second.</p>

<p>"But 'tain't everybody that winds em as
good and solid as you do, Claudina," said another
girl significantly; "windin' loose can
make a ball grow fast, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"'All is not gold that glitters,'" quoted
Mildred.</p>

<p>"I'd begin to wind if I were you," said
Claudina, "you have quite a pile there and it
might get into a tangle."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'm new to the business,"
said Mildred laughing, "and shall take the
advice of an older hand."</p>

<p>"Supper's ready," announced Minerva,
opening the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"Put down your rags and walk right out,
ladies," said Rhoda Jane.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I, for one, need some
preparation," said Mildred, dropping hers and
looking at her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, we'll wash out here," said Rhoda
Jane, leading the way.</p>

<p>A tin bucket full of water, a dipper and
washbasin, all bright from a recent scouring,
stood on a bench in the shed at the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
kitchen door; a piece of brown soap lay there
also, and a clean crash towel hung on a nail in
the wall close by.</p>

<p>The girls used these in turn, laughing and
chatting merrily the while, then gathered about
the table, which was bountifully spread with
good plain country fare&mdash;chicken, ham, dried
beef, pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes,
cheese, eggs, pie, cake and preserves, in several
varieties, hot cakes and cold bread, tea and
coffee.</p>

<p>None of the family partook with their
guests except Rhoda Jane; they would eat afterwards;
and Mrs. Lightcap busied herself now
in waiting upon the table; filling the tea and
coffee cups in the shed where the cooking stove
stood during the months of the year when its
heat was objectionable in the house.</p>

<p>"I don't know as we've earned our supper,
Mis' Lightcap," remarked one of the girls,
stirring her tea; "we hain't begun to git all
them rags sewed up yet."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll just set you to work again
as soon as you're done eatin'; that'll do just as
well; folks don't always pay in advance, you
know."</p>

<p>"And if we don't get through 'fore the boys
come we'll make them help," said Rhoda Jane.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"What boys?" queried Mildred; whereat
several of the girls giggled.</p>

<p>"Why the fellows, of course," laughed Miss
Lightcap; "the boys is what we mostly call
'em; though some of 'em's pretty old, I should
judge, for that."</p>

<p>"Yes, there's Rocap Stubblefield, must be
thirty at least," said one.</p>

<p>"And Nick Ransquattle's twenty-five if
he's a day," remarked another.</p>

<p>"Well, the rest's young enough," said Mrs.
Lightcap. "Pass that cake there, Rhoda Jane.
There's my Gotobed just turned twenty-one,
and York Mocker, and Wallace Ormsby, and
Claudina's brother Will's all younger by some
months or a year or so."</p>

<p>The meal concluded, the work went on
quite briskly again, Mildred catching now and
then a whispered word or two about the desirableness
of getting through with it in time to
have some fun; but the raw material for several
more balls still remained in the basket
when "the boys" began to come.</p>

<p>Gotobed was naturally among the first.
He was quite "slicked up," as Rhoda Jane
elegantly expressed it, though his toilet had
been made under difficulties.</p>

<p>The only legitimate way of reaching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
second story and his Sunday clothes, was by a
stairway leading up from the front room, where
the girls were.</p>

<p>The windows of his bedroom, however,
looked out upon the leanto which formed the
kitchen part of the building and whose roof
was not many feet higher than that of the
shed.</p>

<p>Watching his opportunity for doing so unseen,
he climbed upon the shed, gained the roof
of the leanto, and entered his room by the
window.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the dandy about the
honest fellow, yet somehow dressing was a slow
business with him to-night; he stood before a
little square of looking-glass hanging on the
wall, tying and retying his cravat till it was too
dark to see, then giving up in sheer despair
went down over the roof as he had come, and
sought his mother, who, with the help of Emmaretta
and Minerva, was washing dishes in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"My land!" she exclaimed, as he came in,
"what a time you've been up there. I never
knowed you to take half as long to dress afore."</p>

<p>"My fingers are all thumbs," he said, a hot
flush overspreading his sunburnt face, "I can't
tie this decent nohow at all."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, just wait till I can wipe my hands,
and I'll do it. There, that'll do; the girls ain't
agoin' to look partickler hard at that bit o'
black ribbing."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but I'm obleeged to you all
the same for fixin' it right. Is it time to go
in?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you want to."</p>

<p>He passed out at the back door and through
the yard into the street. He was bashful and
did not like to face such a bevy of girls alone;
at the thought of addressing one of their number
in especial&mdash;Mildred Keith&mdash;he felt himself
grow hot and uncomfortable. He had been
admiring her from a distance all these weeks,
but had never met her, and much as he desired
an acquaintance, his courage seemed
hardly equal to seeking it now.</p>

<p>How rough and boorish, how awkward and
ill-bred he would appear to one so delicate and
refined.</p>

<p>He waited about a little, till joined by a
fellow mechanic, Nicholas Ransquattle, when
they went in together.</p>

<p>This was a wiser step than Gotobed knew;
for his well-made, stalwart figure showed to
good advantage beside that of Nicholas, who
was short and thick-set, had scarcely any neck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
moved like a wooden man, and carried his head
thrown back on his shoulders; he had a wooden
face, too; large featured and stolid in expression.</p>

<p>But he was not troubled with bashfulness
or any fear that his society would be other than
most acceptable to any one upon whom he
might see fit to bestow it.</p>

<p>"Good evening, ladies; I'm happy to meet
you all," he said, making a sweeping bow to
the company as he entered, hat in hand.
"And I hope I see you well."</p>

<p>"Good evening," responded several voices.
"Good-evening, Mr. Lightcap."</p>

<p>"Find yourselves seats and we'll give you
employment, threading our needles for us."</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane was snuffing the candles.
Hastily laying down her snuffers, she introduced
the young men to Mildred, and dexterously
managed to seat Ransquattle on the farther side
of the room, leaving the field clear for her
brother; for an empty chair stood invitingly at
Miss Keith's side.</p>

<p>Gotobed took it, and, almost wondering at
his own audacity, addressed his divinity with a
remark upon the weather&mdash;that never-failing
resource when all other topics elude us.</p>

<p>She answered with gracious sweetness,</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes it has been a lovely day, Mr. Lightcap."</p>

<p>What should he say next.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess you never sewed carpet rags
afore?"</p>

<p>"Is it my awkwardness at the business that
makes you think so?" she returned, with a
quizzical look and smile, as she lifted her fine
eyes to his face.</p>

<p>"No, no, no sirree! ma'am, I mean," he
stammered growing red and hot; "you do it
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Let me give you some work," she said,
taking pity on his embarrassment; "will you
thread this needle for me?"</p>

<p>"And then mine, please," put in Claudina,
who was again seated near her friend; then to
his further relief she launched out into a reminiscence
of a candy pulling they had both attended
the year before.</p>

<p>Others of "the boys" came flocking in, the
work was speedily finished, there was some tossing
back and forth of the balls, amid rather uproarious
laughter; but some of them unwound
and became entangled; and so that sport was
given up; the girls washed their hands as before
supper; Blindman's Buff, Puss in the Corner
and other games were played with as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
zest as if the players had been a parcel of children;
then refreshments followed, served up in
the kitchen; huckleberries with cream and
sugar, watermelons, and muskmelons, doughnuts
and cup cake.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the party broke up and the
young men saw the girls safely home, Gotobed
being so fortunate as to secure the privilege of
waiting upon Mildred to her father's door.</p>

<p>She would, perhaps, have slightly preferred
the attentions of Yorke Mocker, or Wallace
Ormsby; both of whom she had met before and
who were young men of much better education
and much more polish and refinement than
poor Gotobed.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Keith who admitted her daughter;
every one else in the house having retired.</p>

<p>"Had you a pleasant time?" she asked,
with a motherly smile.</p>

<p>"I heard some of the others, as they went
away, saying it had been perfectly splendid,"
Mildred answered with an amused little laugh,
"but the fun was of rather too rough a sort for
me."</p>

<p>"Games?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; and I took part until they
began kissing; when I retired to the ranks of
the spectators."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was right," Mrs. Keith said emphatically.</p>

<p>"And what do you think, mother?" laughed
Mildred. "Viny Apple was one of the guests.
The idea of being invited out to meet your ci-devant
housemaid and cook! isn't it too funny?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, let us be thankful that Celestine
Ann was not invited also; leaving me to
get tea to-night," Mrs. Keith said, joining in
the laugh.</p>

<h2>Chapter Fifteenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"The knight, perusing this epistle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Believ'd h' had brought her to his whistle.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And read it like a jocund lover,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With great applause t' himself twice over."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Butler's Hudibras.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rhoda Jane</span> had set the ball in motion and
for several weeks similar festivities were much
in vogue among the young people of Pleasant
Plains. There were other rag carpet bees,
some quilting, berrying and nutting parties,
boatings on the river, "buggy rides," and rides
on horseback.</p>

<p>Then as the days grew short and the evenings
long, a singing school was started. It met
once a week at Damaris Drybread's schoolroom,
was largely attended by the youth of both
sexes, quite as much for the sport to be got out
of it as for the improvement of their vocal
powers.</p>

<p>Each carried thither a note book and a
tallow candle, and at the end of the term paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
his or her proportion of the salary of the teacher&mdash;one
Timothy Buzzard, from a neighboring
town.</p>

<p>Not the fittest name in the world for a singing
teacher, people said; but then he couldn't
help that, and soon proved himself competent
for what he had undertaken; for imparting instruction
at least;&mdash;as to keeping order among
his pupils, some of whom were years older than
himself&mdash;that he found was quite another thing.
Of course there was often a good deal of misbehavior
on the part of silly, giggling girls and
tittering lads which tried his patience, occasionally
even beyond endurance.</p>

<p>Mildred, Claudina and their friend Lucilla
Grange were not of these; but invariably conducted
themselves in a ladylike manner which
won the admiration and gratitude of the sometimes
sorely tried teacher, and gave him a powerful
motive to self-control, in the natural desire
to win their respect and esteem.</p>

<p>These three girls were the belles of the
town; Timothy was an unmarried man, and
when he seemed to pay court in a manner, to
one or another of them, several of the young
men were inclined to grow wrathy over it, and
to feel that their rights were invaded.</p>

<p>Will Chetwood, Yorke Mocker, and Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Ormsby had become frequent visitors at
Mr. Keith's; though, perhaps not more so in
the case of the latter two, than at the homes of
Mildred's two intimate girl friends; the six
formed a coterie of their own and were generally
seen together at the merry-makings; pairing
off now in one way now in another.</p>

<p>Gotobed Lightcap would now and then
pluck up courage to step in upon Mildred of an
evening, and was invariably treated politely and
kindly, though not in a way to give undue encouragement.</p>

<p>He had an instinctive understanding of that,
attributed it in a great measure, to his own
awkward, ungainly ways, and looked with envy
upon those whose better education and more
polished manners made them more acceptable
companions.</p>

<p>Nicholas Ransquattle was not one of that
number, yet esteemed himself such, and annoyed
our heroine not a little by his unwelcome
attentions.</p>

<p>They were declined whenever it could be
done without positive rudeness, but vanity and
self-conceit are often very blind.</p>

<p>Nicholas was quite a reader for a man of his
station and limited opportunities; his family
were proud of his attainments; he even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
so; he was given to displaying them on all possible
occasions; often wasting a great deal of
breath in the charitable effort to enlighten the
ignorance of his whilom associates.</p>

<p>He would call at Mr. Keith's early in the
evening, and if occasion offered, talk to Mildred
by the hour of his "abstruse studies" and the
lighter literature with which he found it necessary
to "unbend his mind from them," till she
voted him an intolerable bore, and he became
the laughing stock of her younger brothers and
sisters, who found his clumsy, lumbering movements,
self-conceit, and egotistical discourse so
mirth-provoking that they learned to be on the
lookout for him and to find excuses for remaining
in the room while he staid; in which last
endeavor they received every encouragement
from Mildred.</p>

<p>Meanwhile so blinded by egotism was the
man, that he supposed himself an object of great
admiration to them, and had little, if any doubt,
that the whole family were ready to receive him
with open arms whenever he should make formal
proposals for Mildred's hand.</p>

<p>He was a shoemaker by trade; had a little
shop in the principal business street of the town,
just opposite the store of Chetwood and Mocker,&mdash;Claudina's
brother and cousin.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Keith had opened an office next door to
them and Wallace Ormsby was diligently studying
law with him.</p>

<p>Nicholas with a soul above his last, sometimes
envied Wallace the prospective distinction
of being a member of one of the learned
professions, and while busied with his waxed
ends and awl, considered the propriety of offering
himself to Mr. Keith as a student and son-in-law
both in one.</p>

<p>He finally decided that the proposal to
Mildred should be made first, the other to follow
immediately upon her joyful acceptance.</p>

<p>Winter had come in earnest; the ground
had frozen hard and a heavy fall of snow upon
this good foundation had made excellent sleighing;
the young folk were jubilant over it, and
more than one plan for its enjoyment had been
set afloat.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Nick, see here, I want you to
make me a pair o' new boots; put your very
best work on to 'em," said Gotobed Lightcap,
entering Ransquattle's shop after a moment's
vigorous kicking and stamping of the snow
from his feet upon the doorstep.</p>

<p>"All right, Gote. Sit down and off with
your boot," returned Nicholas, putting down
his last and taking up his measures.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me have 'em as soon as you can," said
Gotobed. "And be sure to make 'em a neat
fit," he added, laughing, "else they'll, maybe
be throwed back on your hands."</p>

<p>"They'll give satisfaction, you may depend,"
returned Ransquattle, straightening himself
and throwing his head back on his shoulders
in his accustomed fashion; "whatever I undertake
is always done in the best style."</p>

<p>"Eh! I hadn't noticed that," said Gotobed,
innocently. "You're goin' to the sleighin'
to-morrow night, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I calculate to take Mildred
Keith."</p>

<p>"You do!" Lightcap ejaculated in tones of
mingled anger and inquiry, his brows knitting
wrathfully, a hot flush dyeing his swarthy
cheek. "Have you asked her? got her consent?"</p>

<p>"Her? what her? may I ask?" queried
Yorke Mocker, coming in as Gotobed's question
was propounded, Wallace Ormsby close at his
heels.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't asked her yet, but I shall in
the course of the day; and now I warn you
fellows that she's my choice and you may
each pick out some other girl to take to the
sleighing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! and may I ask how you came by
the right to the first pick?"</p>

<p>"I've as much right to Mildred Keith as
anybody else, Mr. Mocker; more, I should
say; for I'm going to marry her."</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous explosion of astonishment
and indignation at his presumption,
from Mocker and Ormsby, while Lightcap,
thinking no one would dare speak with such
confident boasting who had not received great
encouragement, turned pale, then flushed again
as he picked up and drew on the boot he had
just taken off.</p>

<p>"I admire the modesty of the man," remarked
Ormsby with cutting sarcasm. "I
presume you will find the young lady ready to
drop into your arms at the first hint of your
intentions."</p>

<p>"Of course, since it must be evident to her
that she couldn't possibly do any better,"
sneered Yorke. "Pray, when did you learn
that you were such a favorite?"</p>

<p>"I flatter myself that I do not lack discernment,"
returned Ransquattle, with unmoved
self-complaisance, as he entered his measurements
in his book, then used his coat-tail as a
pen-wiper. "Anything I can do for you this
morning, gentlemen?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," growled Ormsby, "but there's something
I can do for you; namely, save you the
trouble of asking Miss Keith to go with you
to-morrow night by informing you that she
has already consented to allow me to be her
escort."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" exclaimed Ransquattle, reddening
with anger and disappointment. "Well,
I must say I think it's very unfair; the way
you fellows always get ahead of the rest of us."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Gotobed, leaving the shop
and walking away in moody discontent; too
much chagrined at learning that he had no
chance, to enjoy the discomfiture of Nicholas.</p>

<p>"There has been no unfair dealing about
it," retorted Ormsby, shortly, as he and Mocker
followed Gotobed into the street; in their
anger and excitement quite forgetting the errand
that had brought them to Ransquattle's
shop, viz., to borrow his horse and sleigh for
the proposed expedition, in case he were not
going to make use of them himself.</p>

<p>They crossed the street, joined Will Chetwood
in the store, and roused his ire also by
a recital of what had just occurred.</p>

<p>Ransquattle was angry too. "No unfair
dealing about it, eh!" he muttered, looking
after them. "Well, I say there has been;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
they've managed to keep other fellows at a distance
from the girl without any regard to her
wishes. But I'll soon put a stop to that game,
my lads. See if I don't."</p>

<p>He took a letter from his pocket as he
spoke, unfolded it, handling it tenderly, and
glanced over the contents with a smile of self-congratulation.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! we'll see if she'll be able to resist
this!" he said, half aloud, as he refolded and
returned it to its place in the breast-pocket of
his coat.</p>

<p>A sleigh was at that moment standing at
the front door of the yellow house on the corner
and into it Mr. Keith was assisting his wife
and aunt. Then followed the babe and the
three next in age. They were going to the
country, to spend the day with their Lansdale
acquaintances, the Wards.</p>

<p>Mildred, Rupert, Zillah and Ada stood in
the doorway to see them off.</p>

<p>"You won't be back to tea?" Mildred said
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No; but by bedtime," her father answered
as he turned the horses' heads. "Now go in,
all of you, out of the cold before you catch the
ague."</p>

<p>"What did Claudina say?" asked Mildred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
addressing Rupert as they obeyed the
order.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; isn't she always glad of a
chance to come here?"</p>

<p>"That's good. How soon?"</p>

<p>"In about half an hour, I believe she said.
So you'd better hear Ada's lessons and have
them out of the way."</p>

<p>It was some weeks now since Ada's heart
had been rejoiced by a final deliverance from
Miss Drybread's control and a return to the instruction
of her sister. Mr. Lord still kept up
his class and Mildred's zeal for study had not
abated, but the minister had a funeral to attend
at a distant point that afternoon; so there
would be no recitations to interfere with the
pleasure of a day with Claudina. Celestia Ann
still kept her position in the family, and though
only ten o'clock, the house was in order, and
dinner and tea would require no supervision by
the eldest daughter of the house.</p>

<p>Claudina brought her sewing, and the two
passed an uneventful, but pleasant day together,
chatting over their work or reading aloud in
turn; for Claudina was nearly as great a lover
of books as was Mildred.</p>

<p>Their talk was not largely of their neighbors,
but some jests passed between them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>t
Ransquattle's expense. They were quite severe
in their criticisms, as young things are too apt
to be; but if the ears of the victim burned it
was not enough to prevent the act of folly he
had in contemplation.</p>

<p>Tea was over, Miss Hunsinger had removed
the dishes to the kitchen; Mildred spread a
bright colored cover over the table, placed the
candles on it, and she and Claudina settled
themselves to their sewing again; Zillah and
Ada were the only other occupants of the
room, Rupert having gone out.</p>

<p>Presently there came a knock at the outer
door.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Ada, running to open it.</p>

<p>A man, Nicholas Ransquattle, stood on
the threshold. Stepping past the child without
speaking, he made directly for Mildred, and
silently extended his right hand, between the
thumb and forefinger of which he held a letter.</p>

<p>In a sort of maze the girl took it, and with
one of his profound obeisances, of one of which
Cyril had remarked, "I thought he was going
to squattle on the stove when he put his head
down so low," he withdrew without having
spoken a word.</p>

<p>They could hear the crackling of the snow
under his heavy tread as he walked away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Milly, what is it? what is it? what did
he bring it for? had he been to the post-office?"
the little girls were asking with eager curiosity.</p>

<p>Mildred turned to Claudina. They looked
into each other's eyes for a moment, then burst
into a simultaneous hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Did ever you see such a comical performance?"</p>

<p>"Never! It's addressed to you of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Seizing a candle, laughing and blushing,
"Come, help me to read it," Mildred said.
"We'll go up stairs where we won't be disturbed."</p>

<p>"Mayn't we go too? mayn't we know what
your letter's about?" pleaded the little girls as
the older ones were hurrying away.</p>

<p>"No, no! tisn't the sort for children like
you to know about," laughed the sister. "Be
good and stay here. We won't be gone long;
and some day, perhaps, I'll tell you what it says."</p>

<p>They hurried through the kitchen where
Miss Hunsinger was vigorously setting things
to rights, up the crooked stairway and on into
Aunt Wealthy's room, fastened the door and
proceeded to examine the missive.</p>

<p>It was an offer to Miss Mildred Keith, of the
heart, hand and fortune of the writer, Nicholas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Ransquattle, who denominated himself her devoted
worshiper and slave, and addressed her
as an angel and the loveliest and sweetest of
created beings. The girls giggled over it at
first, but at length Mildred threw it down in
supreme disgust.</p>

<p>"Such stuff and nonsense! it's perfectly
sickening! I'm anything but an angel; especially
when I lose my temper. And I believe
I'm losing it now; for I feel insulted by an
offer from such a conceited booby!"</p>

<p>"Somebody's coming!" exclaimed Claudina.</p>

<p>"Yes; Rupert. I know his step. Well,
Ru, what is it?" as the boy rapped lightly on
the door.</p>

<p>"Why before you answer that letter and
accept the fellow, let me tell you something."</p>

<p>Mildred threw open the door.</p>

<p>"Who told you I had one?"</p>

<p>"The children told me about old Nick
bringing you a letter," he answered laughing,
but looking angry too, "and it's easy enough
to guess the subject; particularly since I heard
a bit of news over yonder at the smithy. Gote
Lightcap says he heard him&mdash;old Nick&mdash;boasting
this morning, before several young men,
that he was going to marry Mildred Keith."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>For a minute or more Mildred did not
speak; she had probably never felt so angry in
all her life.</p>

<p>"The conceited puppy!" she cried at last,
"wouldn't I like to take some of it out of
him!"</p>

<p>"Good for you!" cried Rupert clapping his
hands. "I knew you'd be mad. And wouldn't
I like to horsewhip him for his impudence?"</p>

<p>"But it isn't right," said Mildred, already
cooling down a little and ashamed of her outburst.
"You couldn't thrash him, Ru, but instead
you shall, if you will, have the pleasure of
carrying him my answer."</p>

<p>"Tell me what it is first."</p>

<p>Mildred took the letter and wrote, in pencil,
beneath the signature, "The above offer is
positively declined; all future visits on the part
of the writer also," and signed her name.
"There, return it," she said, "with the information
that it is my final reply."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Sixteenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh jealousy! thou bane of pleasing friendship,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou worst invader of our tender bosoms:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How does thy rancour poison all our softness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And turn our gentle natures into bitterness!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rowe.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> news was too good to keep, and Rupert
could not forbear stopping at the smithy on his
return and giving Gotobed a hint of how matters
stood.</p>

<p>To say that the certainty of a decided rejection
of Ransquattle's suit lifted a burden of
anxiety from young Lightcap's mind, is not an
over-estimate of the relief the boy's communication
afforded him.</p>

<p>He had been moody and depressed since his
visit of the morning to Ransquattle's shop, and
had refused to give Rhoda Jane any satisfaction
as to his intentions in regard to making one of
the sleighing party of the following evening.
She was therefore agreeably surprised when toward
bed-time he came, in quite a merry mood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
into the kitchen where she sat sewing alone,
their mother having stepped out to see a neighbor,
to tell her that he had decided to go.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of it," she said, "and who
are you going to take?"</p>

<p>He colored at the question and answered
almost doggedly, "I'm going after Sarah
Miller."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Mildred Keith?"</p>

<p>"'Cause there ain't no use; Ormsby's
headed me off there."</p>

<p>"Yes; an' if you don't look out, with yer
pokin' ways, he'll head you off altogether, and
marry her afore you know it."</p>

<p>"She ain't goin' off in such a hurry," he
muttered, drumming on the table with his fingers;
then jumping up from his chair and going
over to the stove, making a pretense of warming
himself that he might avoid the keen scrutiny
of his sister's sharp eyes; "but what's the
use o' me a tryin' with all them fellers round?"</p>

<p>"Gote Lightcap, I'm ashamed of you!" exclaimed
Rhoda Jane. "If I was a man I'd
have more pluck by a long shot. 'Twouldn't
be me that would let any feller get ahead where
I was amind to go in and win."</p>

<p>"You don't know nothin' about it," he retorted,
lighting a candle and stalking off to bed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me, if he only had half my spunk!"
said Rhoda Jane, looking after him with scornful
eyes and a curling lip.</p>

<p>The wish was echoed more than once in his
heart as he lay awake far into the night revolving
the subject in his mind, and filled with
longings, doubts and fears.</p>

<p>He had been so greatly rejoiced over the
downfall of Ransquattle's hopes; yet after all
what did it avail him while the other three,
whose superiority he could not help acknowledging
to himself, remained in the way? Alas,
there was no great cause for exultation that one
rival out of four had been removed from his
path.</p>

<p>Still was it quite certain that they were all
rivals? might it not be that Miss Chetwood or
Miss Grange was the more attractive girl to one
or all of them? The six were so constantly seen
together, the attentions of the three young men
were so equally divided between the three girls,
that who could tell how they were going to pair
off, if at all?</p>

<p>Besides there was no accounting for tastes
and a lady didn't always select that one from
among her admirers whom other people in
general considered the most desirable match.
There was yet a spark of hope for him, but&mdash;ah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
if he only had Rhoda Jane's pluck and energy
of determination!</p>

<p>Near sunset of the next day a large omnibus
sleigh drawn by four horses with jingling bells,
and well supplied with buffalo robes and other
appliances for keeping the cold at bay, went
from house to house in Pleasant Plains, picking
up the girls and "boys" to the number of a
dozen or more&mdash;a very merry company&mdash;then
glided swiftly on over the snow for some six or
eight miles.</p>

<p>The sleighing was fine, the weather not
severe; the moon rose soon after the setting of
the sun, and the girls being well muffled up in
hoods, cloaks and other wraps, were warm and
cosy, and vastly enjoyed the ride.</p>

<p>Of course the lads did the same. They
laughed, jested and sang, and found time fly as
swiftly as the horses; who seemed to make
nothing of their load.</p>

<p>The destination of the party was a hotel in
a neighboring village, where a supper had been
ordered for them some days before. It was
served up, hot and savory, shortly after their
arrival.</p>

<p>A couple of hours were afterward spent in
the parlor of the hotel, in social chat and playing
games; and here they were joined by Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Timothy Buzzard, who taught a singing school
in this town also.</p>

<p>"There's another rival," thought Gotobed,
jealously watching him carrying on a lively
conversation with Mildred; "'pears like every
body's after her; and I can't get no chance at
all."</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane was equally jealous&mdash;partly for
her brother, but still more for herself; because
last year Mr. Buzzard had waited upon her
more than on any other girl in Pleasant Plains,
and she considered him her property and
"didn't fancy bein' cut out by no newcomer
nor by anybody else, for that matter."</p>

<p>Influenced by the desire to separate the
two, she was the first to suggest that it was
time to start for home. She was agreeably surprised
that Mildred promptly seconded the
motion.</p>

<p>Some objected, saying there was no hurry,
but as it was now eleven o'clock, these were
overruled by the majority, and the sleigh was
presently announced as in readiness.</p>

<p>"Can't we make room for another passenger?"
some one asked, as amid laughter and
jesting, they were crowding into the vehicle.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" queried another.</p>

<p>"Why, Buzzard would&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, we hain't room for no more?" interrupted
Gotobed. "We're not agoin' to have
the ladies crowded."</p>

<p>"Speak fur yerself, Gote Lightcap," spoke
up Rhoda Jane with spirit. "There ain't none
of us so disobligin' as not to be willin' to
scrouge a little for the sake of accommodatin'
a fellow critter in distress. Set up a little
closer, girls, and there'll be lots o' room."</p>

<p>"Yes; the more the merrier, and the closer
the warmer," assented Sarah Miller, Gote Lightcap's
partner for the expedition, who had
noticed with vexation and chagrin his evident
interest in Mildred Keith. "Come on, Buzzard,"
making room for the singing teacher
between Rhoda Jane and herself.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ladies. I shall be a thorn between
two roses," he said, taking the offered
seat with a laugh at his own stale jest.</p>

<p>"Now we've got the singing master along,
let's have some music," said Rhoda Jane, when
they were fairly on their way.</p>

<p>"Yes, you'll be expected to pay your way
Buzzard," remarked Ormsby.</p>

<p>"I hope I'll always be found willing to do
that," he responded. "Miss Lightcap, what
shall I sing?"</p>

<p>Highly pleased that the choice was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
her, Rhoda Jane promptly named a love song
she had heard him sing as a solo.</p>

<p>He gave it, then another, selected by Miss
Miller, then turning to Mildred,</p>

<p>"I think it is your turn now, Miss Keith,"
he said.</p>

<p>She proposed a round he had taught them
that winter, saying all could join in it.</p>

<p>All did so with right good will. Other
rounds, glees, choruses and solos followed. They
sang on even after reaching Pleasant Plains;
sang on till but two or three were left as one
after another was set down at his or her own
door.</p>

<p>A light burned in the parlor at Mr. Keith's
and the front door was opened before the sleigh
had quite drawn up to it.</p>

<p>"Poor, dear mother! what a shame to have
kept you up so long!" Mildred exclaimed as
she came in.</p>

<p>"Never mind," was the cheerful reply.
"Here's a good warm fire; take this arm-chair
close to it, and don't remove any of your wraps
till you cease to feel chilly. I should have
prepared you some hot lemonade but for one
little difficulty in the way; no lemons to be
had. Coffee would keep you awake; but you
shall have a glass of good rich milk; either hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
or cold, as you prefer. Now tell me what sort
of a time you had."</p>

<p>"I wish every girl had such a mother as
mine," Mildred said, smiling fondly up into
the face she loved so well. "I verily believe I
take as much pleasure in recounting my adventures
to you as in going through them.
And it is so nice to have so safe and wise and
loving a confidante.</p>

<p>"Mother, I have a great deal to tell you,
not so much about what has occurred to-night
as of something that happened last night. I
have been looking for an opportunity all day,
but without finding it; for you know we were
unusually busy all the morning and had company
all the afternoon till it was time for me to
get ready for the sleigh-ride."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith glanced at the face of a tall
old-fashioned clock ticking in a corner of the
room.</p>

<p>"I want very much to hear your story,
daughter; but if you can sleep without having
told it I think we will reserve it till to-morrow;
for see! it is now half-past twelve."</p>

<p>The girl would have been glad to unburden
her mind and to learn if her mother approved&mdash;not
her rejection of Ransquattle&mdash;of
that there could be no doubt&mdash;but her manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of doing it; but that dear mother's face
cheerful though it was, told of physical exhaustion
and need of sleep.</p>

<p>Mildred rose hastily. "High time then
that we wore both in bed. My story will keep
perfectly well till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Sit down and finish warming yourself,"
Mrs. Keith said, with a smile. "I want to hear
about to-night. We will keep the longer story
for to-morrow."</p>

<p>The Lightcaps found their house all dark
the family had retired to bed hours ago, but
leaving the kitchen door unlocked and a good
fire in the stove.</p>

<p>"Good and warm in here," remarked Gotobed,
feeling for the candle and matches his
mother was sure to have left on the table ready
for them.</p>

<p>"Yes; feels comfortable. I shall set down
and warm a bit 'fore I crawl up to that there
cold bed-room."</p>

<p>"Me too; don't expect to sleep none when
I do get to bed," growled Gote, as he succeeded
in lighting the candle, after two or three ineffectual
attempts, and set it on the table again.</p>

<p>"Kind o' eggzited are ye?"</p>

<p>"Some. I say, what did you make room
for that&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't swear;" she sneered, as he paused
for a suitable cognomen to bestow upon Buzzard.</p>

<p>"I wa'n't agoin' to!" he said angrily;
"not but what I've sufficient cause in your letting
that unclean bird in amongst us decent
folks."</p>

<p>"There now; that'll do fur to-night," she
snapped. "Tim. Buzzard ain't no more an
unclean bird than you are; he's twicet as good
lookin' and sings like a nightingale.</p>

<p>"But now see here; don't let's quarrel, but
go to work together to bring things round right.
You don't want him to cut you out with Mildred
Keith, and I don't want her to cut me out
with him. So now you just spunk up and pop
the question right off. If you don't, one or
other o' them fellers'll get ahead o' you; you
may just take my word for that."</p>

<p>Gotobed dropped his head into his hands and
sighed deeply, then rose and walked the floor.</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane watched him with an eager,
half-contemptuous look.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said at length, "I wisht I
knowed how!"</p>

<p>"Knowed how! you needn't make many
words about it; 'tain't like makin' up a sermon
or a president's message."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a heap more important; the happiness
of a feller's whole life a dependin' onto it."</p>

<p>Silence for some minutes, Rhoda Jane sitting
meditatively before the stove, her feet on
its hearth, her hands clasped round her knees,
while her brother continued his restless walk.</p>

<p>She was the first to speak. "I'd write it
out if I was you."</p>

<p>"I ain't used to writin' much."</p>

<p>"Well, you can get used to it; you can try
and try till you've writ somethin' that'll do."</p>

<p>"I couldn't write anything good enough for
her to see."</p>

<p>"Then take t'other way."</p>

<p>"I don't never git no chance; and if I did
I'd be tongue-tied, sure as the world."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to write it, and I'll help
you!" concluded Rhoda Jane with energy.</p>

<p>She arose as she spoke, picked up the candle,
stepped quickly to a corner shelf in the next room,
whence she brought an inkstand and a quill pen.</p>

<p>Setting these down on the kitchen table,
she went back, and opening a bureau drawer
where miscellaneous articles were kept, fished
out from its depths a sheet of foolscap, which
she spread out beside the inkstand.</p>

<p>"That ain't nice enough," said Gotobed,
eyeing it disapprovingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make it up on that and get better at the
store to-morrow to copy it onto," returned his
sister. "Now you set down and go at it like
a man; or maybe I'd better say like a woman,"
she added sarcastically.</p>

<p>"If I'd only had an edication!" groaned
Gotobed, taking up the pen; "but it's mighty
hard on a feller&mdash;such things as this is&mdash;when
he hasn't."</p>

<p>"Well, do the best you kin, and mebbe it'll
come out right for all. You're good-lookin'
and got a good trade and can make a good
livin' for her. Just tell her that; and tell her
you think she's as purty as a picter, and good-tempered,
and knows a lot; and that you worship
the ground she walks on, and won't never
let the wind blow rough on her, won't never
say no cross words to her, and&mdash;and a lot more
o' such stuff; that's what girls like."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose you'd ought to know, seeing
you belong to the sect; but it's a heap
easier for you to say it than for me to git it
writ down in black and white," he sighed.</p>

<p>"I declare I'm clear beat out with you
a'most," said Rhoda Jane, snuffing the candle
impatiently; "and I've a great mind to leave
you to make it up by yourself."</p>

<p>But she went on coaxing, suggesting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
prompting, till between them they had composed
an epistle which was satisfactory to her
though not to her brother.</p>

<p>"It's nigh onto three o'clock, and I'm awful
tired and sleepy," she remarked, as at last they
separated and sought their beds.</p>

<p>The next day Gotobed searched the town
for letter paper and bought half a quire of the
best he could find.</p>

<p>During the next week all his leisure moments
were spent in making revised and improved
copies of his and Rhoda Jane's joint
composition.</p>

<p>He had used his last sheet, and seized with
a fit of desperation, he selected the one which
seemed to him the least faulty and sent it by
his sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith, opening the door in answer to
Rhoda Jane's knock, was struck with the peculiar
expression of the girl's face&mdash;a mixture of
pride, condescension and exultation.</p>

<p>"Good evenin' Mis' Keith. Where's Mildred?"
she said, stepping in and glancing
about the room with an air of importance, "I
want to see her pertickler; got somethin' fur
her," and a conscious glance at the missive in
her hand enlightened the quick-witted lady as
to its nature.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mildred is not at home," she said; "will
not be until bedtime; but anything you choose
to leave with me will be given her on her return."</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane considered a moment. She
felt a strong desire to deliver the note into
Mildred's own hand, and to watch her while
reading it; but should she carry it back Gote
might change his mind and put off indefinitely
this business which she was so desirous to have
carried through at once.</p>

<p>She left it, though with evident reluctance.</p>

<p>She presently congratulated herself that she
had done so. Gotobed, eagerly awaiting her
return, peering anxiously every other minute
through the smithy door, hailed her in breathless
excitement.</p>

<p>"Well, what&mdash;what did she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wasn't there. She's gone out somewheres
and won't be back till bedtime."</p>

<p>"Give it to me then; quick!" and he held
out his hand with a peremptory gesture.</p>

<p>"I ain't got it," Rhoda Jane answered with
a sardonic grin.</p>

<p>"Where is it? you ain't gone and left it,"
he cried aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have; I give it to Mis' Keith."</p>

<p>Gotobed groaned. "I'd thought better of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
it; I'd throw it in the fire this minute if I had
it here. She'll think me a fool. I know she
will!"</p>

<p>"If she does she's one," returned Rhoda
Jane shortly, and left him to his unavailing
regrets.</p>

<p>How they tortured him! how could he bear
the suspense.</p>

<p>Mildred was merciful and did not keep him
in doubt any longer than necessary. He found
a letter next morning, in the post-office, with
his address upon it, written in a lady's delicate
graceful hand.</p>

<p>His heart seemed to jump into his mouth
at the sight. He almost snatched it from the
postmaster's hand, and without stopping to answer
the jesting remark of that functionary on
his sudden accession of color, hurried away,
never stopping till he reached the privacy of
his own room, thankful that he succeeded in
doing so without being seen by any of the
family.</p>

<p>But now it was a full minute ere he could
summon courage to open the missive and learn
his fate. And even when it lay open before
him he passed his hand several times across his
eyes as if to clear his sight.</p>

<p>Yet it was very plainly written;&mdash;also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
plainly expressed; a distinct, decided, though
very kindly rejection of his suit; the only reason
given that she could not love him and a loveless
marriage could be fruitful of nothing but
misery to both parties.</p>

<h2>Chapter Seventeenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"The rose that all are praising<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is not the rose for me."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baylie.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Gotobed Lightcap</span>, you're the biggest fool
that ever was born!" exclaimed the young
blacksmith, between his clenched teeth, throwing
Mildred's dainty note upon the floor and
grinding it with his heel, while the hot blood
surged over his swarthy face, which expressed
in every lineament intense mortification and
chagrin. "You might 'a knowed the likes o'
her couldn't never fancy sech a ungainly, know
nothin' varmint as you be."</p>

<p>He dropped his face into his hands for a
moment, groaning in spirit&mdash;for the wound in
his heart was deep as well as that to his pride.</p>

<p>"It does seem as if there warn't nothin' left
in this world worth livin' fur!" he sighed.
"But then I'm not the feller to give up and
die! I'll fight it out an' get over it yet."</p>

<p>He picked up the letter and thrust it into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
bosom, straightened himself, went down into
the smithy, and fell to work at his anvil, dealing
vigorous blows as if thus he would drive
away the demon of despair.</p>

<p>He ate little at dinner, and conscious that
Rhoda Jane's sharp eyes were upon him,
scarcely lifted his from his plate.</p>

<p>He hurried back to his work. She followed
him the next minute.</p>

<p>"So she's give you the mitten?"</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" he asked defiantly,
standing before her with arms folded and head
erect, but reddening to his very hair.</p>

<p>"Humph! I ain't blind, and anybody could
see it with half an eye. Well, never you mind!
you're a sight too good fur her, the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you call her no names now! I ain't
agoin' to have it. It's me that isn't fit to hold
a candle to the like o' her, and had ought to had
sense enough to know it.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't boast like Ransquattle;
that's one small bit o' comfort as things has
turned out," he concluded moodily, picking up
his hammer.</p>

<p>"How'd he take his mitten?" laughed
Rhoda Jane. "Wouldn't I ha' liked to seen
him puttin' it on!"</p>

<p>"Take it! you never see anybody look so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
cheap as Nick when Mocker asked him 'tother
day when the weddin' was to come off. Then
the fellers run him ('twas at Chetwood and
Mocker's store; I'd run in on a arrant fur
mother) and he growed thunderin' mad, and
begun callin' her names till Ormsby was ready
to put him out&mdash;if he hadn't walked off hisself&mdash;and
I could 'a horse-whipped him with a
right good will."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you go and break your heart
fur her."</p>

<p>"I ain't a goin' to. There now, you'd
better leave; fur I've a job on hand."</p>

<p>The building lot selected by the Keiths was
bought and fenced in almost immediately, and
men set to work at digging the cellar, and then
putting up the walls of the new house.</p>

<p>By dint of energetic oversight and urging on
of the workmen, Mr. Keith succeeded in having
it roofed in before the first heavy fall of snow;
so that some advance could be made with the
laying of floors, lathing, etc., during the winter.</p>

<p>When spring came things took a fresh start;
more men were employed and every effort put
forth by the owner, to have the building hurried
on to completion.</p>

<p>Each member of the family was deeply interested;
the children made daily journeys to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the spot and all Rupert's leisure time was devoted
to digging, planting and other improvements
of the grounds.</p>

<p>The boy was full of energy and fond of life
in the open air. His garden did him credit,
supplying nearly all the vegetables wanted for
family use.</p>

<p>With some assistance from older heads and
hands, he terraced the bank overlooking the
river, made steps down to the water's edge,
where was a fine spring, and built a small arbor
and a spring-house.</p>

<p>The new dwelling would be hardly so large
as the one they were to leave for it, until an
addition should be built, but of more sightly
appearance and far more conveniently arranged.
Besides it was their own, and who does not know
the charm that ownership gives?</p>

<p>They were very impatient to get into it;
and there was great rejoicing among the children
when at last the announcement was made
that it was fit for occupancy.</p>

<p>It was their father who brought the news
into their reading and sewing circle, one bright
warm afternoon early in July.</p>

<p>"When shall we move, wife?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh to-night, to-night! please, mother say
to-night," cried several little voices.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Keith laughed. "It is no such quick
work, children."</p>

<p>"But we might bedin," said Don. "I'll
take dis tat and tum back aden for other
tings," hugging up a large white and yellow
cat that had been a petted member of the
household for some months past.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Cyril, "Toy can take his own
self; he's got more feet to run with than any
of the rest."</p>

<p>"And he always runs alongside wherever
we goes," put in Fan. "Mother can we help
move?"</p>

<p>The question was unheard and remained
unanswered; for the reason that the older people
were talking busily among themselves.</p>

<p>"I think we may begin to-morrow," Mrs.
Keith was saying; "Celestia Ann is through
with her week's washing and ironing, and I'll
set her and Mrs. Rood both to cleaning the new
house, while we pack up things here."</p>

<p>"Oh, goodie, goodie! mother, mayn't we
all help!" chorused the children.</p>

<p>"We will see, dears; perhaps there may be
some little things that you can carry; your own
toys you shall carry at any-rate, if you wish.
Yes, Stuart, I have had the parlor and one bedroom
of the new house cleaned already."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"O mother, can't we have this carpet
taken up immediately&mdash;I mean go to work and
take it up&mdash;and have it shaken and carried right
over there? and perhaps we could get it down
this afternoon, you and auntie and I; and have
the furniture of that room carried right into it
to-morrow morning, the first thing."</p>

<p>"A capital idea," her father said; "then we
will have one room comfortable there before
all are torn up here. Come, children, scamper
out of the way! Wife; where's the tack hammer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, can't we help?" pleaded the children,
"Where shall we go?"</p>

<p>"No, not with this. Go anywhere out of
the way."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed somewhat reluctantly,
all going out to the adjoining room. Zillah
and Ada stopped there and each took a book;
the younger three went up stairs.</p>

<p>"Let's pack up our things," said Cyril.</p>

<p>"What'll we pack 'em in?" queried Don.</p>

<p>"We'll see."</p>

<p>The boys got out their stores of marbles,
balls, bits of twine, a broken knife or two, a few
fish hooks and a set of Jackstraws their father
had made for them.</p>

<p>Fan brought out her treasures also, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
consisted of several dolls and their wardrobes,
a picture book and some badly battered and
bruised dishes; the remains of a once highly
prized metal toy tea set.</p>

<p>A packing box in one corner of the large
second story room was where the playthings of
the little ones were always kept when not in use.
"A place for everything and everything in its
place," being one of the cardinal rules of the
household.</p>

<p>"Can we take 'em over there now?" asked
Fan, as she gathered hers pell mell into her apron.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said Cyril. "Didn't
you hear mother say we couldn't begin moving
till to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Then what did we get 'em out for?"</p>

<p>"To pack 'em up and have 'em ready to
take over in the morning."</p>

<p>"What'll we pack 'em in?" reiterated Don.</p>

<p>"Let's look round for a box 'bout the right
size," said Cyril. "Course we can't carry them
in the big board one. It's too heavy."</p>

<p>A good deal of rummaging followed upon
that; first in the outer room, then in the other,
occupied by Aunt Wealthy and Mildred.</p>

<p>Finally they came upon a pasteboard box
standing on Mildred's writing table, which
Cyril pronounced just the thing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"But maybe Milly won't like us to take it,"
objected Fan, as he unceremoniously emptied
the contents upon the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't care; there's nothing in it
but old papers and things writed all over.
She's done with them and she'll be puttin'
them in the fire next thing. You know she
always likes to burn up old rubbish."</p>

<p>That last statement was certainly according
to fact, and Fan made no further objection.</p>

<p>Don suggested asking leave, but Cyril overruled
that also.</p>

<p>"No; they're all too busy down there; we
mustn't bother," he said, walking off with his
prize.</p>

<p>One paper had fallen on the floor. Fan
stooped, picked it up and looked at it curiously,
as the boys hurried off into the other room with
their prize.</p>

<p>"Milly didn't do that," she remarked;
"tain't pretty writin' like hers. Guess she
wouldn't want to keep such an ugly old thing."</p>

<p>"Come Fan," Cyril called, "do you want
to put your things in too?"</p>

<p>"Yes;" she said, coming out with the letter
still in her hand.</p>

<p>Fan's dolls were put in last and the box was
too full to allow the lid to go on.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll take Bertha and carry her in my
arms," she said, lifting out her largest and
favorite child. "I want her to play wis now
and I'd raser not trust her in dere wis dose
marbles and balls rollin' round."</p>

<p>"Now the lid fits on all right," said Cyril,
adjusting it.</p>

<p>"We're all packed up," observed Don, with
satisfaction. "Now let's go play in the
grove."</p>

<p>The others were agreed and Fan decided
that she must take with her two small rag dolls
in addition to Bertha.</p>

<p>Puss had come up stairs with the children
and was walking round and round them, as
they sat on the carpet, rubbing affectionately
against them and purring loudly.</p>

<p>"Let's give 'em a ride on Toy's back," said
Cyril. "Here's a string to tie 'em on with,
and this old letter shall be the saddle," picking
up the one Fan had brought from the other
room, and which she had laid down beside the
box.</p>

<p>The others were pleased with the idea;
Cyril twisted the letter into some slight resemblance
to a saddle, and in spite of a vigorous resistance
from the cat, tied it and the dolls pretty
securely to her back.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>She was of course expected to go with or
follow them as usual; but the instant they released
her she flew down the stairs, darted out
of the open kitchen door, tore across the yard
and scaled the fence in a twinkling.</p>

<p>The children pursued at their utmost speed,
but Toy was out of sight before they could
descend the stairs.</p>

<p>"Well, I never! that 'ar cat must a gone
mad," Celestia Ann was saying, standing in the
doorway, her hands on her hips, her gaze turned
wonderingly in the direction Toy had taken.</p>

<p>"Where? which way did she go?" asked
the children breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Over the fence yonder, tearing like mad.
She went like a streak o' lightnin' through the
kitching here, and I didn't see no more of her
after she clum the fence. She's got the hydrophoby
bad, you may depend; and I only hope
she won't bite nobody, 'fore somebody knocks
her in the head."</p>

<p>"No, it's my dolls she's got," said Fan, who
had not the slightest idea what "hydrophoby"
might be. "O, boys, hurry and catch her 'fore
she loses 'em," she called after her brothers as
they renewed the pursuit, hurrying across the
yard and climbing the fence with a speed that
did credit to their ability in that line.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Fan stood beside it, gazing out anxiously
through a crack between the high, rough boards
till the boys returned all breathless with running,
to report, "No Toy and no dolls to be
seen anywhere."</p>

<p>"But don't cry," added Cyril, seeing Fan's
lips tremble ominously; "she'll come back when
she wants her supper; you bet."</p>

<p>"It's wicked to bet," remarked Don virtuously.</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Cyril, "come let's go play
in the grove. I'll bend down a tree and give
you a nice ride, Fan."</p>

<p>Gotobed Lightcap had just finished a job,
and pausing a moment to rest, was wiping the
perspiration from his brow with a rather dilapidated
specimen of pocket-handkerchief, when a
cat darted in at the open door, ran round the
smithy in a frightened way, then lay down on
the floor and rolled and squirmed kicking its
feet in the air in the evident effort to rid itself
of something tied to its back.</p>

<p>With a single stride Gotobed was at the side
of the struggling animal.</p>

<p>He took it up and in a few seconds had relieved
it of its hated incumbrance.</p>

<p>"It's them Keith children's pet cat," he
said half aloud, "and they've been a tyin' some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of their doll babies onto it. There you kin go,
puss; don't take up yer lodgin' here; for we've
cats enough o' our own.</p>

<p>"Eh! what's this?" as his eye fell on the
letter and he recognized his own awkward, ill-shaped
hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>He felt his face grow very red and hot as
he straightened it out upon his knees, his heart
fluttering with the thought of the possibility
that it might have been some little liking for
the writer that had prevented its immediate
destruction.</p>

<p>There were some words in pencil along the
margin; he held it up to the light and slowly
deciphered them.</p>

<p>He was not much accustomed to reading
writing and this had become slightly blurred:
but he made it out clearly at last; a jesting remark
about his mistakes in spelling and grammar,
which were many and glaring.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ha' believed it of her!" he exclaimed,
crimsoning with anger and shame as
he flung the torn and crumpled sheet into the
fire of his forge, the dolls after it.</p>

<p>He caught up his hammer and fell to work
again, muttering to himself, "It's her writin';
there can't be no mistake; fur it's just like what
she writ me afore. And I wouldn't a' believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
it of her, I wouldn't; I thought she'd a kind
heart and would make allowance fur them that
hasn't had the same chance as her."</p>

<p>He had not been wrong in his estimate of
Mildred. She would never have wounded his
feelings intentionally. She had a habit of
writing her thoughts on the margin of what
she was reading, and the words had been carelessly
traced there with no expectation that they
would ever be seen by any eye but her own.
Nor would they but for the mischievous meddling
of the children.</p>

<p>She set no value upon the letter; did not
miss it till months afterwards, and then supposed
she had destroyed it, though she could not distinctly
remember having done so.</p>

<p>In the meantime Gotobed kept his own
counsel, concealing his hurt as well as he could
and trying not to hate the hand that had inflicted
it.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Eighteenth.</h2>

<div class='center'>
"Farewell, a long farewell."<br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Keiths were scarcely more than well
settled in their new home when Miss Stanhope
announced her intention of returning to
Ohio almost immediately.</p>

<p>This news was received by the family with
something akin to consternation. "How could
they do without her?" they asked; "didn't
everybody need her every day of their lives,
from father and mother down to Annis?"</p>

<p>"Ah," she answered smiling, though her
eyes were dim with unshed tears, "you'll have
each other and will soon find that you can get
on very well indeed without your blundering
old auntie. But the question is how shall she
do without you? The old Lansdale home will
be very lonely with no little feet pit-patting
about it."</p>

<p>"Then what makes you go, Aunt Wealthy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
chorused the children, clinging to her with
many a loving caress.</p>

<p>"I must, my darlings; there's business I
have to attend to; and I feel that the ague is
breaking me down."</p>

<p>"I fear that is too true," Mrs. Keith said,
with a strong effort to speak cheerfully, "and
therefore I will not entreat you to stay, dear
auntie; but rather urge your departure before
the sickly season sets in.</p>

<p>"Though it just breaks my heart to think
of the parting!" she added, hurrying from the
room to conceal her emotion.</p>

<p>"But you'll come back soon, won't you,
auntie?" pleaded the children.</p>

<p>"Not very, I'm afraid, dears, it's a long and
expensive journey."</p>

<p>"Too long for you to take alone, Aunt
Wealthy," Mildred said. "I dread it for you.
I don't see how we can let you go without a
protector."</p>

<p>"I shall not, child. Is not the promise to
me, 'Behold, I am with thee, and will keep
thee in all places whither thou goest?' Yes;
to me and to each one of His children. So I
am not afraid, and you need not fear for
me."</p>

<p>"Dear auntie, if the Saviour were here, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
think he would say to you, 'O woman, great
is thy faith!'"</p>

<p>"My dear, I deserve no such commendation;
my faith is often very weak. But I want
you to remember and try to realize that this
almighty Friend not only goes with me when
I leave you, but stays with you also; according
to His gracious promise, 'I will never leave
thee nor forsake thee.'</p>

<p>"Troubles and trials will come and there
are dark and stormy days in every life&mdash;but 'as
thy days so shall thy strength be.'</p>

<p>"I can not tell you, Mildred, how hard it
is for me to leave you all," she continued, her
voice trembling with emotion, "but it would
be ten times harder were it not that I know
'this God is our God forever and ever;'
and that 'he will be our guide even unto
death.'"</p>

<p>"Aunt Wealthy," said Mrs. Keith coming
in again, "Stuart and I have been talking this
over&mdash;this resolve of yours to return to Ohio&mdash;and
he says it will never do for you to attempt
it without an escort."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad of an escort, if there
is one to be had," Miss Stanhope answered;
"but if not, I must even go without&mdash;trusting
in Providence."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you would wait a few weeks rather
than go alone?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; God works by means, and we
are to use them, while at the same time we
trust only in him."</p>

<p>"Stuart says the merchants will be going
on East to buy their fall goods. He will inquire
among them and let you know."</p>

<p>"Ah yes; I think I heard Mr&mdash;&mdash; what's
his name? Mimicker? Sneerer?"</p>

<p>"Mocker?" suggested Mildred with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Mr. Mocker, I heard him say
something about it being his turn this fall to
lay in a new supply of goods."</p>

<p>"Ah, I hope it will turn out that you will
have him for your escort, Aunt Wealthy," said
Mildred, "for I know that he will take the
best possible care of you. But do try, auntie,
to get his name fixed in your memory."</p>

<p>"That I will," Miss Stanhope answered
with a good humored smile; "for he might
not fancy the synonyms of it; the meaning not
being the most complimentary in the world."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith brought home word that Mr.
Mocker would leave for the East in a fortnight
and would be happy to take charge of
Miss Stanhope.</p>

<p>Aunt Wealthy had always been very dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to these nieces and nephews, but now that they
were about to lose her, it seemed to them that
they had never realized half her worth.</p>

<p>They lingered near her, they hung upon
her words and looks, and when the time for
parting came, clung about her with sobs and
tears, loading her with caresses, till she was
forced to tear herself from their embraces and
hurry away.</p>

<p>The stage had drawn up before the gate;
she hastened down the garden path, the weeping
children running after; Mr. Keith and
Mr. Mocker assisted her into the vehicle, the
latter took his place by her side, and in another
moment she was whirled away out of sight, all
drowned in tears, and leaving the others in like
condition.</p>

<p>"It seems just like a funeral!" sobbed Ada,
"oh, will she never, never come back any more!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she may, dear," said the mother,
wiping away her own tears, "we will try to
think so at least, and be cheerful and happy in
looking forward to that time. And in the
meanwhile we may hope for a letter now and
then."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Rupert, "that reminds me that
there's a letter in the office for you now,
mother! I saw it there, but had no money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with me to pay the postage. If you'll give me
the two shillings, I'll run and get it now."</p>

<p>"Do so, my son," Mrs. Keith said, giving
him the money. "I'm sorry you forgot it
and did not get it out in time for Aunt
Wealthy to see it."</p>

<p>Letters were rarities in those days, and the
older members of the family awaited Rupert's
return from the post-office with a good deal of
eagerness, not unmixed with anxiety.</p>

<p>He was not long gone for he too was curious
in regard to it, desirous to learn its contents
and who was the writer.</p>

<p>"It's post marked Detroit," he said, delivering
it to his mother. "I can't think who'd
be likely to write to any of us from there.</p>

<p>"Unless it might be Captain or Edward
Wells," he added with a quizzical glance at
Mildred.</p>

<p>"The hand looks familiar," remarked Mrs.
Keith carefully breaking the seal; then opening
out the sheet, "Horace Dinsmore!" she
exclaimed, "And he is coming to see us! Oh,
what a pity that Aunt Wealthy has just missed
him!"</p>

<p>"A pity indeed!" echoed her husband.
"But he may stay with us some weeks, and
perhaps take Lansdale on his way home."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope he won't; won't stay here long, I
mean," muttered Rupert in an aside to Mildred.
"I didn't like him the other time."</p>

<p>"Nor I, very much, but perhaps he has
improved."</p>

<p>"Mother, who is he?" the younger ones
were asking.</p>

<p>"My cousin; his mother and mine were
sisters."</p>

<p>"Were? Aren't they now?" queried Zillah.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, but they both went home to
heaven many years ago. My mother first&mdash;before
Aunt Eva married Mr. Dinsmore and
went away down south to live.</p>

<p>"But wait till I have read the letter and
then you may ask all the questions you wish."</p>

<p>It was not a lengthy epistle. Mrs. Keith
glanced over it, then read it aloud. Its tone
was cousinly and affectionate.</p>

<p>The writer stated that he had lately graduated
from college and was now taking a tour
to rest and refresh himself after many months
of hard study; that he had arrived in Detroit,
would tarry there a week and then journey
on into Indiana to visit his relatives in Pleasant
Plains.</p>

<p>"This letter has been some time on the
way," Mrs. Keith remarked, examining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
date, "and really I think he may walk in upon
us day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then we'd better be getting ready for
him!" exclaimed Mildred, starting up in her
energetic way.</p>

<p>"Wait a little. Mother promised to tell us
about him," cried the children.</p>

<p>"Yes, and will. There's time enough,
Milly."</p>

<p>Mildred resumed her seat; for she, too,
wanted to hear all her mother had to tell.</p>

<p>"My mother," Mrs. Keith began, "was
two years younger than Aunt Wealthy, who
was the daughter of my grandfather by his first
wife; therefore only half sister to my mother
and Aunt Eva, who were the children of the
second.</p>

<p>"Aunt Eva was five years younger than my
mother and was still single when mother died;
which, as you have all heard, was when I, her
only child, was but little more than two years old.</p>

<p>"Cousin Horace, too, was the only child of
his mother, and quite a little fellow when she
died. I was there, on a visit, at the time and
did what I could to comfort him.</p>

<p>"We grew quite fond of each other then
and have always been so ever since, though we
have lived far apart and met very seldom."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he got a father?" asked Cyril, "and
does he live with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has a father, and lives with him
when he is at home; but for years past most of
his time has been spent at school and college."</p>

<p>"I thought Cousin Horace had brothers and
sisters?" Rupert said, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; his father soon married again and
has a large family by the second wife."</p>

<p>"What is Cousin Horace like, mother?"
asked Ada.</p>

<p>"Wait until he comes and see for yourself,"
was the smiling rejoinder.</p>

<p>"How glad you look, mother!" said Mildred,
"are you really so much pleased that he is
coming?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, my child! he is my near
kinsman, and, as I have just told you, I am
very fond of him; he's like a dear younger
brother to me. And particularly welcome just
now as his coming will take from the dreadfully
lonely feeling Aunt Wealthy's departure has
given the house."</p>

<p>"But, mother, we can't entertain him suitably,
we're so cramped for room and our house
only half-furnished; and he is used to living in
such grand style. You know you have often
told me about it&mdash;what a beautiful place Roselands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
is, and how many carriages and horses,
and what a retinue of servants they keep."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith smiled kindly at the anxious
face turned toward hers. "Well, daughter
dear, we'll just do the best we can for him
and it won't hurt him to try roughing it in the
backwoods&mdash;or prairies rather&mdash;for a little
while."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a little better than if he had
come while we were in the old yellow house.
We've a nice porch here, and a front yard
shaded with grand old oaks; and no neighbors
near enough to watch every movement."</p>

<p>"A good many conveniences, too," added
her mother, cheerily, "and a beautiful view of
river and town. I think, too, that we can
manage to give him a room to himself, and to
feed him well, with the help of Rupert's garden,
the cow and the chickens."</p>

<p>The expectation of this visit was a real
blessing to the family; to Mrs. Keith and Mildred
in especial&mdash;just at this time; giving occupation
to their thoughts as well as hands, in
the necessary preparation for the proper accommodation
and entertainment of the coming
guest; thus preventing much of the sadness
the loss of Miss Stanhope's loved society would
have caused them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The next arrival of the semi-weekly stage
brought Horace Dinsmore, his servant and luggage
to their door.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore was a dark-eyed, handsome
youth of distinguished appearance and with the
air of a prince of the blood royal; yet evidently
a kind master; for his man John, a spruce
young negro, seemed to take the greatest pride
and pleasure in waiting upon "Massa Horace"
and anticipating his every wish.</p>

<p>While warmly welcoming her young relative,
Mrs. Keith was somewhat dismayed at the
unexpected sight of the servant&mdash;house room
being so scarce; but the difficulty was obviated
by placing a cot-bed in the empty loft of the
newly erected stable at the foot of the garden.</p>

<p>"How very thoughtless and selfish in
Cousin Horace to bring that fellow along," Mildred
said to her mother.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, not when we consider that
they have always been together and neither
would know very well how to do without the
other. I was the thoughtless one not to remember
that and expect John."</p>

<p>"Always together, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they are nearly the same age&mdash;John
a few months older than his young master&mdash;and
were playfellows in infancy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"John's mother was Horace's 'mammy' as
the children down south call their nurses; and
I think loved her white nursling even better
than her own children.</p>

<p>"John's affection for Horace is probably as
great, and it would come near breaking his
heart to be separated from him."</p>

<p>Horace Dinsmore had paid a visit to Lansdale
the year before the removal of the Keiths
to Indiana. The impression he had then made
upon his young cousins was not at all favorable;
he was silent, morose and seemed to take little
or no interest in anybody or anything.</p>

<p>"He is not like himself," Mrs. Keith had
said to Aunt Wealthy again and again; "he is
in trouble, some great sorrow has come to him."</p>

<p>But they did not succeed in winning his
confidence; he rejected their sympathy, locked
up his secret in his own bosom, and left them
as sad and moody as when he came.</p>

<p>He was changed for the better now; was
cheerful, at times even gay, and showed much
interest in them and their affairs, making them
valuable presents; for he had large means and
a generous nature.</p>

<p>Some gifts&mdash;of dress-goods, jewelry and
children's toys, he had brought with him, and
in addition he presented Mildred and Rupert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
each with a town lot in the immediate neighborhood
of their new home.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith, in his sturdy pride of independence,
was inclined to reject these last; but his
wife said,</p>

<p>"No, Stuart, do not; you will hurt Horace's
feelings; the land is very cheap, the price of it
nothing to him with his large wealth; I know
it is a real pleasure to him to give it to the
children."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith yielded the point and said
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore, not being a religious man,
and belonging to a very proud and aristocratic
family, was not one to mingle with those he
denominated "the common herd," as his cousin well
knew. Therefore only a few of their acquaintances&mdash;the
educated and refined&mdash;were
invited to meet him and accompany them on
some little excursions&mdash;riding, boating, and
fishing&mdash;gotten up for his entertainment.</p>

<p>He made himself agreeable on these occasions;&mdash;an
easy thing for him to do with his
handsome person, polished manners and good
conversational powers&mdash;but soon let it be known
to his relatives that he decidedly preferred exclusively
family parties. After that they had only
such while he staid, which was for several weeks.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Nineteenth.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Seldom shall she hear a tale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So sad, so tender, and so true."</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Horace Dinsmore</span> showed much interest
in Mildred, seemed to like to watch her, let
her employment be what it might, and to have
her company in long solitary walks and drives.</p>

<p>Several times he remarked to her mother
that she was growing very lovely in person and
was a girl of fine mind; adding that he sincerely
hoped she would not throw herself away upon
some country boor.</p>

<p>The two&mdash;Mrs. Keith and Mr. Dinsmore&mdash;were
alone in the sitting-room, one pleasant
afternoon early in September, when this remark
was made for the third or fourth time; alone
except that little Annis was playing about the
floor, apparently absorbed with Toy and her
doll.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith was sewing, her cousin who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had been pacing to and fro, now standing before
her.</p>

<p>She lifted her head with a startled look.</p>

<p>"Horace, don't forget that you and Mildred
are cousins."</p>

<p>He colored slightly, then laughingly answered
to her thought rather than her words,</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Marcia; I'm not thinking
of her in that way at all."</p>

<p>His face suddenly clouded as with some
gloomy recollection.</p>

<p>"Marcia," he said, taking a chair near her
side, "my visit is drawing to a close and there
is something I must tell you before I go; I
came with the purpose of doing so, but hitherto
my heart has failed me. We seem to be alone
in the house and perhaps there will be no better
time than this."</p>

<p>"I think not," she said, "we can secure
ourselves from intrusion by locking the door."</p>

<p>He rose, turned the key, and came back.</p>

<p>He did not speak again for a moment, but
sat watching Annis with a peculiar expression
which excited his cousin's surprise and curiosity
and not for the first time either; she had
noted it before; the child seemed to both attract
and repel him.</p>

<p>More than once Mrs. Keith had seen him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
snatch her up suddenly with a gesture of strong
affection, only to set her down the next minute
and turn away as if from something painful to
look upon.</p>

<p>"What is it you see in my baby, Horace?"
she asked, laying her hand affectionately upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"She is a sweet, pretty little thing, yet it
gives me more pain than pleasure to look at
her," he said sighing and passing his hand
across his brow.</p>

<p>"You cannot imagine why it should," he
went on, smiling sadly into his cousin's wondering
face, "because there is a page in my past
life that you have never read."</p>

<p>His features worked with emotion. He
rose and paced the floor back and forth several
times; then coming to her side again,</p>

<p>"Marcia, I have been a husband; I am a
father; my little girl&mdash;whom I have never
seen&mdash;must be just about the age of Annis."</p>

<p>"You, Horace? you are but twenty years
old!" dropping her work to look up at him in
utter amazement.</p>

<p>"I knew you would be astonished&mdash;that
you could hardly credit it&mdash;but it is true."</p>

<p>Then resuming his seat he poured out in
impassioned language, the story already so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
known to the readers of the Elsie books&mdash;of
his visit to New Orleans three years
before this, his hasty and clandestine marriage
to the beautiful heiress, Elsie Grayson, their
speedy separation by her guardian and big
father, the subsequent birth of their little
daughter and the death of the young mother, following
so soon thereafter.</p>

<p>Her work forgotten, her hands lying idly in
her lap, her eyes gazing intently into his, Mrs.
Keith listened in almost breathless silence, the
tears coursing down her cheeks during the saddest
passages.</p>

<p>"My poor Horace! my poor, dear cousin!"
she said when he had finished. "Oh, it was
hard, very hard! Why did you never tell me
before."</p>

<p>"I could not, Marcia," he answered in tremulous
tones, "it is the first time I have spoken
my darling's name since&mdash;since I knew that
she was lost to me forever."</p>

<p>"Forever! oh do not say that! You
have told me she was a sweet Christian girl,
and none who trust in Jesus can ever be
lost."</p>

<p>"But to me; I am no Christian," he sighed.</p>

<p>"But you may become one. The invitation
is to you, 'Come unto me;' and the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
assurance, 'Him that cometh unto me, I will
in no wise cast out.'"</p>

<p>He sat silent, his face averted, his head
bowed upon his hands.</p>

<p>She waited a moment, then spoke again.</p>

<p>"Your child, Horace?"</p>

<p>"She is at Viamede with the guardian."</p>

<p>"And you have never seen her?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh how can you bear it? doesn't your
heart yearn over her? don't you long to have
her in your arms?"</p>

<p>"No; why should I? she robbed me of
her&mdash;my darling wife."</p>

<p>"But you do not know that? and certainly
it was innocently, if at all."</p>

<p>"That has always been my feeling."</p>

<p>"You ought not to allow yourself to feel
so," she said almost indignantly. "Poor little
motherless darling! must she be worse than
fatherless too?"</p>

<p>"What would you have, Marcia?" he asked
coldly, his face still turned from her, "what
could I do with a child? And she is well off
where she is; better than she could be anywhere
else;&mdash;under the care of a pious old
Scotch woman who has been house-keeper in
the Grayson family for many years, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of her mammy who nursed her mother before
her: a faithful old creature so proud and fond
of her young mistress that I doubt if she would
have hesitated to lay down her life for her."</p>

<p>"That is well so far as it goes, Horace, but
do you wish your child to grow up a stranger to
you? would you have no hand in the moulding
of her character, the training of her mind?"</p>

<p>"I had not thought of that," he said sighing,
"but I do not feel competent to the task."</p>

<p>"But it is your work; a work God himself
has appointed you in giving you the child; a
work for which he will give wisdom if you seek
it of him.</p>

<p>"'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth
not: and it shall be given him.'</p>

<p>"And if you neglect it, my dear cousin,&mdash;bear
with me, while I say it&mdash;it will be at your
peril."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Marcia?"</p>

<p>"The day may come when you will want
that child's love and obedience: when you will
covet them more than any other earthly good,
and perhaps, find that they are denied you."</p>

<p>"It is possible you may be right in regard
to the first," he said haughtily, his dark eyes
flashing, as he turned his face towards her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
again, "but as to the other&mdash;her obedience&mdash;it
will be strange indeed if I cannot compel it.
She may have a strong will, but she will find
that mine is yet stronger."</p>

<p>"Horace," said his cousin earnestly, "if you
refuse or neglect to do a father's duty by her,
what right can you have to claim a child's duty
from her?"</p>

<p>"I am not conscious of having neglected
my duty toward her thus far," he said, still
haughtily. "As I have already explained, she is
where, in my judgment, she is better off for the
present, than she could be anywhere else.
What changes may come in the future I do not
know."</p>

<p>"Forgive me if I have seemed to blame you
undeservedly," Mrs. Keith said with tears in
her eyes; "but ah, my heart yearns over that
poor baby!"</p>

<p>She caught up her own and kissed it passionately
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she sighed, pressing the little creature
to her bosom, "whatever would my darlings
do without a father's and a mother's
love!"</p>

<p>He walked to the window and stood there
for several minutes. Then coming back,</p>

<p>"Marcia," he said, "will you do me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
favor to write about this to Aunt Wealthy
and tell her I have always felt ashamed of my
behavior during my visit to you both, two years
ago. I could not bring myself to explain then
the cause of my&mdash;what shall I call it? sullenness?
It must have looked like it to you and
her and to all who saw me.</p>

<p>"But you will understand it now and perhaps
have some charity for me."</p>

<p>"We had then, Horace," she said, "we
were sure it was some secret grief that made
you so unlike your former self. Yes, I will
write to Aunt Wealthy. May I tell your story
to Mildred also?"</p>

<p>"Not now, please. When I am gone she
may hear it."</p>

<p>"Excuse another question. Do you know
anything of your little one's looks?"</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing; but if she at all
resembles her mother, she must be very pretty."</p>

<p>"And you have never even asked! O
Horace!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you think me very heartless,"
he said, coloring. "But you must make some
allowance for my being a man. Women, I
think, feel more interest in such things than we
of the sterner sex do."</p>

<p>"Then I think my husband must be an exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
man, for he loves his children very
dearly, and takes great pride in their beauty
and intelligence."</p>

<p>"I daresay; it might have been the same
with me under happier circumstances," he answered
in a bitter tone.</p>

<p>Little feet came pitpatting through the hall,
little voices were asking for mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore opened the door and admitted
the inseparable three.</p>

<p>"Mother, I'm cold," said Fan shivering,
and her teeth chattering as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Cold, darling? Come here."</p>

<p>"She's got a chill," remarked Cyril sagely.
"I'm as warm as toast. It's real hot in the sun
where we've been playing."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she has; her nails are quite
blue," Mrs. Keith said, taking one small hand
in hers. "Come, dear; mother will put you to
bed and cover you up nice and warm, and give
you something hot to drink."</p>

<p>"Me too, mother," said Don, creeping to
her side and laying his head on her shoulder,
"I'm so tired and my head aches so
bad."</p>

<p>His cheeks were flushed, his hands hot and
dry.</p>

<p>"You, too, mother's little man?" she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
"Mother is so sorry for you both.
Have you been cold, Don?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, and it creeps down my back
now."</p>

<p>"Take care of Annis, Cyril," said Mrs.
Keith, and excusing herself to her cousin, she
led the sick ones away.</p>

<p>Coming back after some little time, "I
found Ada down, too," she sighed. "She had
crept away by herself, without a word to any
one&mdash;poor, dear child! 'not wanting to trouble
mother,' and there she lay shaking till the very
bed shook under her."</p>

<p>"It's dreadful!" cried Mr. Dinsmore,
"positively dreadful, Marcia! How can you
stand it! I believe there has hardly been a
week since I came when you were all well."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's because there are so many of
us!" she answered, laughing, though tears
sprang to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do you stay here! I'd pack up everything
and be off instanter."</p>

<p>"Necessity knows no law," she said.
"Cyril, son, can you go down to the spring and
get some fresh water for the sick ones?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; I'll take the biggest bucket;
cause folks always want to drink so much water
when the chill's on 'em."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cyril knows that by experience," his
mother remarked as the boy left the room.</p>

<p>"Why do you speak of staying here as a
necessity, Marcia?" asked her cousin. "You
had as large a fortune from your mother as I
from mine."</p>

<p>"Riches take wings, Horace, and a large
family and unfortunate investments supplied
them to mine."</p>

<p>She spoke cheerfully, jestingly, as though it
were but occasion for mirth, but his tone was
full of concern as he answered,</p>

<p>"Indeed I never knew that. It is a thousand
pities! I wonder you can be so content
and light-hearted as you seem."</p>

<p>"Ah, I have so much left! All my chiefest
treasures,&mdash;husband, children, many great and
precious promises for both this life and the
next."</p>

<p>"Ah, but if you stay here, how long are you
likely to keep husband and children? not to
speak of the danger to your own life and
health."</p>

<p>"Sickness and death find entrance everywhere
in this sad world," she said; her voice
trembling slightly, "and in all places we are
under the same loving care. It seems our duty
to stay here, and the path of duty is the safest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
It is thought that in a few years this will become
a healthy country."</p>

<p>"I hope so, indeed, for your sake, but it is a
hard one for you in other ways. I am not so
unobservant as not to have discovered that you
do a great deal of your own work. And I don't
like that it should be so, Marcia."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she answered, smiling
up brightly into his face as he stood looking
down upon her with a vexed and anxious expression,
"It is very nice to have you care so
much for me, Horace."</p>

<p>"There's nobody in the world I care more
for, Marcia," he said, "and going over some of
our late talk, in my mind, I have thought there
is nobody to whom I should so much like to
commit the care and training of my child. I
mean, of course, if your hands were not already
full and more than full with your own."</p>

<p>"They are not so full that I would not
gladly do a mother's part by her," she answered
with emotion, "were it not for the danger of
bringing her to this climate."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the difficulty. It would never
do, so miasmatic and so cold and bleak during
a great part of the year; especially for one
born so far south. But I thank you, cousin, all
the same."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have not much sickness here except
ague," she remarked presently, "but there are
several varieties of that&mdash;chills and fever occurring
at regular intervals&mdash;generally every other
day at about the same hour; dumb ague, shaking
ague, and sinking or congestive chills; which
last are the only very alarming kind, sometimes
proving fatal in a few hours."</p>

<p>"Indeed! you almost frighten me away,"
he said half seriously, half in jest. "That is
not a very common form, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, rather rare."</p>

<p>"Don't you send for the doctor?"</p>

<p>"Not often now; we did at first, but it is
so frequent a visitor that we have learned to
manage it ourselves."</p>

<p>The sickly season had fairly set in, and more
afraid of it than he liked to acknowledge, Mr.
Dinsmore hastened his departure, leaving for
the East by the next stage.</p>

"I marked the Spring as she pass'd along,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While she stole in peace o'er the green earth's breast,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 15em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Willis Gaylord Clark.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, I'm both glad and sorry Horace is
gone," Mrs. Keith remarked with a smile, a
sigh and a dewy look about her eyes, as the
stage passed out of sight. "I'm fond of the
lad, but was troubled lest the ague should get
hold of him. Besides, the dearest of guests is
something of a burden with sickness in the
house and a scarcity of help."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is very true, mother," Mildred
answered, "and so thoroughly do I realize it
that I am wholly and heartily glad he's gone;
albeit I liked him much better this time than I
did before."</p>

<p>Celestia Ann had left months ago, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
had had very indifferent help during Mr. Dinsmore's
visit, though fortunately such as they
could keep away from the table when their
guest was present at it.</p>

<p>Mildred went on now to express her satisfaction
that such had been the case, adding,
"What would he have done if Miss Hunsinger
had been here, and in her usual fashion asserted
her right to show that she felt herself as good
as he or anybody else?"</p>

<p>"He'd have annihilated her with a look,"
laughed Rupert.</p>

<p>"He would have acted like the perfect gentleman
he is," said Mrs. Keith, "but it would
have been exceedingly mortifying to me to have
him so insulted at my table; for as he has been
brought up, he could not avoid feeling it an
insult to be put on a social equality with one so
rude and vulgar."</p>

<p>"The house feels lonely," said Zillah, "it
seems 'most as if Aunt Wealthy had just gone
away."</p>

<p>"We'll get our sewing and a book," said
her mother, "Come all into the sitting-room.
Rupert may be the reader this time.</p>

<p>"Mildred, you and I will have to be very
busy now with the fall sewing."</p>

<p>"Yes mother dear; it's a blessing to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
plenty of employment. But do you think I
shall need to give up my studies for a time?"</p>

<p>"No, daughter, I hope not. I want you to
go on with them; Mr. Lord says you are doing
so nicely. Your cousin, too, told me he
thought you were getting a better&mdash;more thorough&mdash;education
with him, than you would be
likely to in any school for girls that he knows
of."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes sparkled, and cousin Horace
took a warmer place in her affections than he
had held before. It was well, for it needed all
that to keep her from disliking him for his indifference
toward his motherless little one,
when, a few days later, she heard his story from
her mother's lips.</p>

<p>They had a very busy fall and winter, missing
sorely Miss Stanhope's loved companionship
and her help in the family sewing, the
putting up of fruit&mdash;the pickling and preserving,
indeed in every department of household
work; and in nothing more than in the care
of the sick.</p>

<p>Letters came from her at rare intervals&mdash;for
mails were infrequent in those days and postage
was very high&mdash;were read and re-read, then
put carefully by to be enjoyed again when time
and opportunity could be found for another perusal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
They were not the brief statements of
facts that letters of the present day generally
are, but long chatty epistles, giving in pleasing
detail, her own doings and those of old friends
and acquaintances, and all that had happened
in Lansdale since they left; telling of her pets,
of the books she read and what she thought of
them.</p>

<p>Then there were kind inquiries, conjectures
as to what they were doing and thinking;
answers to their questions, and words of counsel
and of tender sympathy in their joys and
sorrows.</p>

<p>Many a laugh did they give their readers,
and many a tear was dropped upon their pages.
They so loved the dear old lady and could
almost hear the sweet tones of her voice as they
read or repeated to each other, her quaint sayings.</p>

<p>Fall and winter passed, bringing with them
no marked changes in the family, but very
much the same round of work, study and diversion
as in the former year.</p>

<p>The children grew, mentally and physically,
now mother, and now sister Mildred, "teaching
the young ideas how to shoot;" for they
could not endure the thought of resigning the
precious darlings to the tender mercies of Damaris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Drybread, whose school was still the only
one in town.</p>

<p>The old intimacy was kept up in just the
old way among the coterie of six, and the gossips
vainly puzzled their brains with the question
which girl was the admired and admirer of
which young man.</p>

<p>Mildred was happily freed from the visits
of Ransquattle&mdash;of which Lu Grange had become
the impatient and disgusted recipient&mdash;and
saw little of Gotobed Lightcap, who, upon
one excuse, or another, absented himself from
most of the merry-makings of the young people.</p>

<p>Indeed there had been scarcely any intercourse
between the two families since the removal
of the Keiths from the immediate
neighborhood of the Lightcaps; for there was
no similarity of taste, no common bond of interest
to draw them together; nothing in truth,
save a kind and friendly feeling toward each
other; and as regarded Rhoda Jane, even this
was lacking.</p>

<p>She had never yet forgiven Mildred's rejection
of her brother and almost hated her for it,
though she knew naught of her added offense
in the matter of the criticism on his letter.
That was a secret which Gotobed kept faithfully
locked in his own breast.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The spring opened early for that climate;
with warm rains that brought vegetation forward
rapidly.</p>

<p>The Keith children revelled in out door
work and play; each of the younger ones had a
little garden to dig and plant as he or she
pleased, and a pet hen or two in the chicken
yard, and there was much good-natured rivalry
as to who should have the earliest vegetables,
the greatest variety of flowers, the largest broods
of young chicks, or the most newly laid eggs to
present to father and mother, or the invalid of
the hour; for the old enemy&mdash;ague&mdash;still visited
them occasionally; now one, now another,
or it might be several at once, succumbing to
its attacks.</p>

<p>However, the lion's share of both gardening
and poultry-raising fell to Rupert; who busied
himself out of study hours, with these and many
little odd jobs of repairing and adorning&mdash;such
as mending fences, putting up trellises, training
vines and trimming shrubbery and trees.</p>

<p>The mother and Mildred found so much to
do within doors, that some oversight and direction
of these younger workers, and the partial
care of a few flower-beds near the house, were
all they could undertake outside.</p>

<p>They had been without a domestic for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
weeks, had passed through the trying ordeal of
the regular spring house-cleaning with only
Mrs. Rood's assistance, when one pleasant May
morning, while dishing up breakfast, their hearts
were gladdened by the sight of the sinewy form
and energetic countenance of Celestia Ann
Hunsinger as she stepped in at the kitchen door
with a characteristic salutation.</p>

<p>"How d'ye, Mis' Keith? You don't want
no help round here, do ye?"</p>

<p>"We want just the sort of help we'll be sure
of if you'll take off your bonnet and stay," Mrs.
Keith answered, giving her a hearty grip of the
hand.</p>

<p>"Then that's what I'll do and no mistake,"
returned the girl, setting down a bundle on a
chair, with the remark, "You see I've brought
some o' my duds along," pulling off her sunbonnet
and hanging it on a nail. "Here, Miss
Mildred, let me smash them 'taters."</p>

<p>"So Mis' Keith, you've been buildin' since
I was here last."</p>

<p>"Yes; a new kitchen; so we could take the
old for a dining-room and be less crowded."</p>

<p>"It's awful nice; I always did like a good
big kitching;&mdash;room to turn round and keep
things straight."</p>

<p>"It's going to be nicer still, Celestia Ann,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>"
said Rupert who had just come in from his
work in the garden, and was washing his hands
preparatory to taking a seat at the table, "it
wants a coat of paint on the outside and I'm
going to put it on myself, to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" she ejaculated, "do ye
think you're up to that?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do; and so, I suppose, do
father and mother; or they wouldn't have consented
to let me try."</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothin' like tryin'; as I've
found out in my own experience," returned Miss
Hunsinger, using her potato masher vigorously,
"and I allers enjoy meetin' with folks that's
willin' fur it. But do you know, Mis' Keith,
'pears to me like 'I can't' comes the easiest to
most human critters' tongues of any two words
in the American language; and with more'n
half on 'em they're lyin' words; yes, there's
more lies told in them two words than in any
other ten. So there!" as she laid down her
masher to stir in the milk, butter and salt.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there is only too much truth in
your remark," said Mrs. Keith, "but certainly
no one can accuse you of a fondness for that
favorite phrase of the indolent and ease-loving."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mis' Keith. I've lots of faults
and failin's as well's the rest o' the human family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
but I'm certain sure there ain't no lazy bone
in my body.</p>

<p>"Here these taters is ready to set on the
table, and I see you've got your steak and biscuits
dished up. But I hain't inquired after
the fam'ly. Anybody got the agur?"</p>

<p>"No, I believe we are all well this morning
thanks to a kind Providence. Rupert, call
your father and the rest to breakfast."</p>

<p>No frowns greeted Celestia Ann as she, with
her accustomed nonchalance, took her place
with the others. Everybody was glad to see
her, because her arrival meant comparative rest
for mother and Mildred, and more time to be
devoted by them to the loving care and entertainment
of father and the younger children.</p>

<p>After breakfast, family worship. Then Mr.
Keith went to his office and the others scattered
to their work or play. Sunbonnets and hats
were in request among the little ones; for
mother had given permission to go out if they
would be careful to keep on the gravel walks
till the dew was off the grass.</p>

<p>Sister Mildred gave kind assistance, and
away they ran, while she and Zillah and Ada,
old enough now to begin to be useful about the
house, made beds, dusted and set things to
rights in sleeping and dwelling rooms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Rupert donned a suit of overalls and went to
his chosen task.</p>

<p>Celestia Ann needed but little direction or
oversight, and in half an hour Mrs. Keith repaired
to the sitting-room.</p>

<p>What a pleasant place it seemed as she
came in!&mdash;fresh and bright from its recent
cleaning, neat as a new pin, the open windows
looking out upon the grassy side yard, with its
shrubbery and trees clothed in vivid green, and
giving a charming view of the clear waters of
the swiftly flowing river sparkling in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a lovely morning, mother?" cried
Mildred, whose graceful figure was flitting
about here and there, putting a few finishing
touches to the adornments of the room. "I
think the sunshine was never brighter, the air
never sweeter. It is a luxury just to live!
Hark to that robin's song and the sweet prattling
of the little voices you and I love so well!
And I feel as blithe and gay as a bird."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child," said the mother, happy
tears springing to her eyes, "Oh, how great is
His goodness to us unworthy creatures! so
much of mercy and blessing here and the certainty
of endless joy and bliss beyond! Life
has its dark and dreary days, but after all there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
is more of brightness, to those who look for
it, than of gloom."</p>

<p>"I believe that is true, mother," responded
Mildred, "though when the dark and dreary
days are upon us, it is sometimes very difficult
to hold fast to one's faith.</p>

<p>"I do love this time of year," she added,
leaning from the window to watch the ferryboat
slowly crossing,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,<br />
A box where sweets compacted lie.'"<br />
</div>

<p>"Come, let us go out; I think we may
spare an hour to the garden this morning,"
Mrs. Keith said gayly, leading the way.
"What a blessing, among others, it is to have
a good reliable girl in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed Mildred, "I could almost
have hugged Celestia Ann; I was so glad to
see her. What do you suppose brought her
just at this time, mother?"</p>

<p>"Need of money for summer finery, I presume.
See, our morning glories are coming
up nicely."</p>

<p>"Mother, mother, and Milly," cried Fan
running to them in an ecstasy of delight, "my
speckled hen has thirteen little chicks, the
prettiest bits of fuzzy things you ever saw.
Do come and look!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned and sped back again toward the
chicken yard, mother and sister following.</p>

<p>The other three little ones were there watching
"Speckle" and her brood with intense interest.</p>

<p>"See! see! mamma, Milly! see! see!"
cried Baby Annis in a flutter of delight, holding
her little skirts close to her chubby legs, as the
"bits of fuzzy things" ran hither and thither
about her feet, "pitty 'ittle chickies, dust tum
out of eggs."</p>

<p>"Yes, dears, they are very pretty," Mrs.
Keith said; "but they are very tender little
things; so be careful not to hurt them. No,
Cyril, don't pick them up, and be sure you
don't step on them. You may go to the house
for some bread crumbs, Fan, and you and Annis
may feed them."</p>

<p>This permission gave great pleasure, and
Fan's small feet went skipping and dancing
through the garden in the direction of the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>Then mother must look at Annis's hen sitting
on her nest, and notice how the older
broods, belonging to Cyril and Don, were
growing in size and strength; Zillah's and
Ada's also; and hear how many eggs the other
nests had furnished this morning.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>After that the gardens were submitted to
her inspection, Mildred still bearing her company,
both making suggestions and giving assistance.</p>

<p>And so a full hour had slipped by before
they returned to the house, and Rupert, they
found, had made great progress with his work.</p>

<p>"I've painted the whole end, mother; do
you see?" he called to her; "and now I'm beginning
this side. I think I'll have the whole
job done to-day."</p>

<p>"You have been very industrious," she said,
"but don't make haste so fast that it will not be
done well."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, ma'am, I don't intend to."</p>

<p>He was at the top of his ladder and near
the roof of the new one-story addition to their
house.</p>

<p>"Take care, my son," said Mrs. Keith; "it
seems to me your ladder doesn't stand very
securely. Is there no danger of its slipping?"</p>

<p>"Never a bit, mother," laughed the boy
"why what should make it slip?"</p>

<p>She and Mildred turned and walked on toward
the front of the house, had just set foot
upon the porch there, when a shout from Rupert
startled them and made them pause and
look back at him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>They saw the ladder slip, slip then slide
rapidly to the ground, while with a cry of alarm
they rushed toward him.</p>

<p>But they were much too far off to reach
him in time to be of the least assistance. Down
he came to the ground, falling with considerable
impetus and alighting upon his feet, his
brush in one hand, his paint pot in the other,
striking with a force that sent the paint all
over his person.</p>

<p>He reeled and dropped.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt? oh, my boy, are you much
hurt?" asked his mother tremulously, as she
hurried to him, looking very pale and frightened.</p>

<p>"My clothes have got the worst of it, I believe,
mother," he said, laughing and staggering
to his feet. "I'm afraid they've robbed
the house of half its new coat."</p>

<p>The others came running from chicken-yard
and garden; Celestia Ann poked her head out
of the kitchen window, and a peal of laughter
met him from all sides.</p>

<p>"I dare say I cut quite a comical figure,"
he said, taking it in good part, "but since I've
broken no bones, I wouldn't care a red cent, if
it wasn't for the loss of the paint and the damage
to my illegant attire.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>"'O what a fall was there, my countrymen.'"</p>

<p>"Since you are unhurt, no matter for the
clothes; even if they were an elegant suit,"
said his mother, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"But half the paint's gone, mother&mdash;or at
least put upon my person where it's worse than
useless," cried the lad, surveying himself with
an expression so comically lugubrious that there
was a fresh explosion of mirth.</p>

<p>"Never mind; it will not cost a great deal
to replace it," said Mrs. Keith. "But I think
the job may wait now till we can get a regular
house-painter to finish it up."</p>

<p>"What! would you have me give up so
easily, mother, and own myself beaten? I don't
like to do it. Please let me try again, and I'll
place the ladder more carefully."</p>

<p>"I don't know; we'll ask your father first.
There's no special haste and&mdash;how would you
all like to go with me for a walk? a nice long
stroll down to the bridge, and over the river,
to look for wild flowers."</p>

<p>The proposal was greeted with loud acclamations
and clapping of hands. "Oh, delightful!"
"Oh goodie! goodie!" "May we
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we've all been working hard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
long time, and I think really deserve a holiday.
Rupert, make yourself decent and we'll set out
at once, taking a lunch with us, so that we need
not hurry home."</p>

<p>"Tan I do, mamma? tan Annis do?" asked
the baby girl eagerly, the rosy face all aglow
with delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, mother's darling; you shall
go in your little coach; because your dear little
feet couldn't travel fast enough to keep up with
the rest, and would get so tired."</p>

<p>"Do we need to be dressed up, mother?"
asked Fan, "me and Don and all the children?"</p>

<p>"No, dear; we don't go through town and
are dressed quite enough for the woods."</p>

<p>They were soon on the way, strolling leisurely
along, drinking in with keen enjoyment
the sweet sights and sounds.</p>

<p>The sky over their heads was of a dark
celestial blue with here and there a floating
cloud of snowy whiteness, whose shadow flitted
over the landscape, giving to it a charming
variety of light and shade.</p>

<p>Their road lay along the bank of the river
and its soft murmur mingled with the hum of
insects and the song of birds. The grass beneath
their feet was emerald green thickly
studded with wild flowers of every hue, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
groves of saplings through which they passed
were fast donning their summer robes.</p>

<p>The bridge was a rough wooden structure
half a mile below the town; quite out of danger
of crowding the houses of the citizens or
doing much injury to the custom of the ferry.</p>

<p>The walk was a longer one than the younger
children were accustomed to take, but there
was no occasion for haste&mdash;they were in search
of rest and pleasure, and when little feet grew
weary, mother let them stop and amuse themselves
with making wreaths and bouquets of
the flowers they had gathered, or by throwing
stones into the river, till they were ready to
go on again.</p>

<p>They did not go far beyond the bridge;
only climbed the bank, on the other side,
picked a few flowers there, and were ready to
return.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"You are meek and humble mouth'd;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With meekness and humility; but your heart</span><br />

</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, what's that? what's that?" cried a
chorus of young voices, as Mrs. Keith and her
little troop, returning from their morning stroll,
stepped into the front porch at home.</p>

<p>"What indeed!" echoed the mother, as
much surprised as any one of the others. "It
looks very like a box of goods; but where could
it come from?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Wealthy," suggested Mildred, examining
it with a curious eye.</p>

<p>"Ah, so you have come back at last, eh?"
said Mr. Keith coming out with a smiling face.
"That's been waiting for you for over an hour,"
consulting his watch. "Come let's have dinner
and then we'll see what's inside."</p>

<p>"Is it ready?" asked Mrs. Keith, taking off
her bonnet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; barely time for the washing of small
hands and faces," he said, picking up Annis and
racing off to the nursery with her; for so they
called the room where the little ones slept and
were dressed and undressed, though but a small
part of the day was ordinarily spent there.</p>

<p>There was no lingering over the dinner
table, though the meal was a good one, and the
children's appetites had been sufficiently keen
until they saw the box.</p>

<p>They ate and drank with dispatch, taking
time for but little talk beyond a few conjectures
as to its probable contents.</p>

<p>Father and mother certainly shared their
curiosity and eagerness to some extent, and did
not keep them waiting long.</p>

<p>A few minutes' work with the hatchet and
the lid was off.</p>

<p>"Just newspapers!" cried Don, in a tone of
bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, laddie," laughed Rupert.</p>

<p>"Something else under, I guess," said Cyril,
while father, mother and Mildred made haste to
lift and lay aside the papers for further perusal,
for newspapers were too rare in those days to
be despised, even though some weeks old.</p>

<p>"Books! oh delightful!"</p>

<p>"How good and kind in her!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we'll have a feast!" exclaimed one
and another in varying tones of gladness.</p>

<p>"What are they? let us see," said Mr. Keith
proceeding to lift them out one or two at a time,
and with a glance at the titles on the backs,
handing them to wife, son or daughter.</p>

<p>"Cooper's Naval History of the United
States! There, that will particularly interest
you, Rupert.</p>

<p>"And here are his novels, which mother and
Mildred will enjoy. Scott's works also: those
for older folks and his 'Tales of a Grandfather'
for the children. Two more little books&mdash;'Anna
Ross,' and 'Ruth Lee.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, they look pretty!" cried Zillah and
Ada, peeping into these last.</p>

<p>"'Dunallan' for me! oh how glad I am!"
exclaimed Mildred the next instant.</p>

<p>"Here's a bundle," said Mr. Keith, handing
it out.</p>

<p>"Remnants, I presume," his wife said laughingly,
and opening it found her surmise correct.</p>

<p>Groceries, candies and toys for the children,
and some few other miscellaneous articles filled
up the rest of this most welcome box.</p>

<p>"Dear old auntie! She shouldn't have
wasted so much of her money on us," Mrs.
Keith said with tears in her eyes, as she glanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
over a note pinned to a dress pattern for herself.
"But she says she has enjoyed it intensely,
and I know that is so; for giving, especially to
us, is her greatest delight."</p>

<p>"Yes, there never was a more generous
soul," assented her husband.</p>

<p>"Ah, if we could only do something for her
in return!" exclaimed Mildred.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! what a feast she has provided
us!" cried Rupert, taking a peep here
and there into the history. "Mother, can't we
begin on them this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I'm not ready for Mr. Lord," objected
Mildred, "and in an hour it will be time to go
to him."</p>

<p>That reminded the lad that he, too, had a lesson
to prepare, and he left the room to attend to it.</p>

<p>"Wife," said Mr. Keith, "do you know
that little Mary Chetwood is seriously ill?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not, I'll put on my bonnet and
go over there at once."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Mildred, "I've been thinking
it would be nice to lend one of these books
to Effie Prescott. I do not know her at all intimately,
but Claudina says she is very intelligent
and fond of reading, and in such poor
health that she is often too miserably weak and
ill to do anything but read."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly! she must have the reading of
every book in the house, if she wishes, and will
not abuse them."</p>

<p>"Claudina says she is always very careful of
those she lends her, and very glad to get them.
She's a lovely Christian, too, and very patient
under her trials."</p>

<p>"Yes; I have been pleased with the little I
have seen of her. I believe I owe Mrs. Prescott
a call; so I shall take their house on my
way to the squire's and carry a book with me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith found Mrs. Prescott out, the invalid
girl lying back in a large rocking chair,
and Damaris Drybread seated, in her accustomed
bolt upright fashion, directly opposite.</p>

<p>At sight of Mrs. Keith, Effie started up in
nervous haste and trepidation, to offer her
hand and then a chair.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear child, I will help myself,"
said the lady, pressing the trembling
hand tenderly in hers. "How are you to-day?"</p>

<p>"About as usual, thank you; which is
neither very sick nor very well," the girl answered
with a faint smile, sinking back again,
breathing short and hard.</p>

<p>"Now don't talk so; you look very well,"
remarked Miss Drybread in a cold, hard tone.
"Just make up your mind that there's nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
much the matter, and you're not going to give
up to the hypo, and ten to one it won't be long
till you find yourself well enough."</p>

<p>Tears sprang to Effie's eyes, for she was
both nervous and sensitive to the last degree.</p>

<p>"I know I look well," she said. "I'm not
thin, and I have a good color; but it's often
brightest when I feel the worst. And I've
tried to believe my sickness was all imagination,
but I can't; it's too real."</p>

<p>"No, Effie, you do not look well," said Mrs.
Keith; "that brilliant bloom hardly belongs
to health, and your eyes are heavy, your countenance
is distressed."</p>

<p>"Of course she'll wear a distressed countenance
as long as she imagines she's sick," observed
the schoolma'am severely. "And you,
Mrs. Keith, are only making matters worse by
talking in that way."</p>

<p>"Not so," said the sick girl, "such kind
sympathy does me good. Oh, thank you a
thousand times!" as Mrs. Keith put "Dunallan"
into her hands. "I shall enjoy it so much,
and will be very careful of it, and return it
soon. I read it years ago and liked it exceedingly,
and it will be new to me now.
Grace Kennedy is such a sweet writer; what a
pity she died so early!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"A novel!" sniffed Damaris. "If you are
really sick you oughtn't to read anything but
the Bible."</p>

<p>"The teachings of this book are so fully in
accord with those of the Scriptures, that I can
not think it will hurt her," said Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>"I love the Bible," said Effie, "I never
could do without it; its words often come to
me when I am sad and suffering and are
'sweeter than honey and the honeycomb,' but
reading other good books seems like talking
with a Christian friend, and refreshes me in the
same way."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Prescott came in and
greeting the two callers with a pleasant "Good
afternoon," sat down to chat with them.</p>

<p>The talk presently turned upon their gardens,
and Mrs. Prescott invited the visitors to
walk out and look at hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith accepted the invitation, but
Miss Drybread said she would just sit with
Effie till they came back.</p>

<p>"Aren't you teaching now, Miss Damaris?"
asked the girl, as the others left the room.</p>

<p>"No, I've closed my school for a couple of
weeks to do my spring sewing."</p>

<p>"It was kind in you to take time to call to
see me when you are always so busy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I try to attend to every duty," returned
the schoolma'am, with a sanctimonious air "and
I felt that I had a duty to perform here. I've
been thinking a good deal about you, Effie;
trying to find out why your afflictions are sent;
and I've concluded that it's as a punishment
for your sins, and that when you repent and
reform, your health will be better.</p>

<p>"You know Christians (and I really hope
you're one; I know you belong to the church)
won't have any punishment in the other world;
so they have to take it in this, and so, as I
said, I've been considering about you, and I
think if you thought better of Brother Smith
and enjoyed his sermons and prayers and talks
in the meetin's, 'twould be better for you.</p>

<p>"He's a good Christian and so you'd ought
to like what he says, and be his friend with
other folks that isn't inclined to listen to him."</p>

<p>"He may be a Christian; I hope he is,"
returned Effie, "though it is very difficult for
me to realize that a man has much true love to
Christ and for souls, when his tone and manner
are utterly indifferent and business like (or
perhaps that isn't quite the right word; for
men generally show some interest in their business).</p>

<p>"Besides it requires other things in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to conversion to fit a man for teaching; he
must have knowledge and the ability to impart
it.</p>

<p>"I have nothing against Mr. Smith personally,
but he does not instruct me, does not give
me any food for thought, or help me on my way
to heaven. So I felt it my duty to object to having
him become my pastor. But I haven't been
going about slandering him, and don't know
why you come and talk to me in this way.</p>

<p>"It strikes me, too, that you are the last
person to do it&mdash;as I have heard you say far
harder things of other ministers than ever I've
said of him."</p>

<p>An angry flush rose in the sallow cheek of
the spinster at that.</p>

<p>"I've tried to do my duty always," she
said, bridling. "I've never indulged in any
vanities of dress; but that's been one of your
sins, Effie Prescott; bows and even flowers and
feathers on your bonnets, and knots of bright
ribbon at your throat and in your hair. It's
sinful and you may depend you'll be afflicted
till you'll give up and be consistent in all
things."</p>

<p>"I know better than you can tell me, that
I deserve all I suffer and a great deal more,"
said the girl humbly, tears gathering in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
eyes; "but for all that I don't believe you are
right. You are a Job's comforter, and God reproved
those men for talking so to him.</p>

<p>"And don't you remember what Jesus said
about trying to take the mote out of your
brother's eye while there is a beam in your own?"</p>

<p>"I see its time for me to go," said Damaris,
rising.</p>

<p>She stood a moment looking at Effie, her
lips compressed, her face white and her eyes
ablaze with rage.</p>

<p>"There's no Christian spirit about you," she
hissed, "you don't like faithful dealing; you
don't want to be told of your sins. Very well,
Miss, I wash my hands of you; I shake off the
dust of my feet against you."</p>

<p>And with arms folded on her breast and
head erect, she stalked out of the house, leaving
the invalid girl quivering from head to foot
with nervous excitement and distress, crying
and laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" she sighed to herself.
"I haven't behaved in a Christian manner; I
was angry at what she said."</p>

<p>Mrs. Prescott and Mrs. Keith were strolling
in from the garden, chatting pleasantly of their
domestic affairs, when an infant's screams were
heard coming from a back room.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, my baby is awake and calling for
his mother," said Mrs. Prescott. "Please excuse
me a minute. Just step into the parlor
again and talk with Effie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith complied and found Effie alone,
lying back in her chair, trembling, flushed and
tearful.</p>

<p>"My poor child! are you suffering very
much?" she asked, bending over her and
smoothing her hair with a caressing motion.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, I'm not worse&mdash;only&mdash;it was
something that Damaris said; and that I didn't
take it quite as I ought.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Keith, do you think God sends
sickness to punish us for our sins? and that my
health is poor because I'm more wicked than
anybody who is well?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I have excellent health as
a general thing, while many an eminent saint
has been a great sufferer.</p>

<p>"We know that sin brought disease and
death into the world and that God sometimes
sends afflictions as chastisements; but to his own
people it is in love and for their growth in
grace.</p>

<p>"'As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten;
be zealous therefore and repent.' 'Whom the
Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening,
God dealeth with you as with sons.'</p>

<p>"Remembering that, would you wish to
escape it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! But oh, it makes the burden so
much heavier to think that it is because He is
angry with me!"</p>

<p>"It is because he loves you. Do not look at
it as punishment, but as discipline; as the cutting
and carving which are necessary to bring
out the beautiful statue from the shapeless block
of marble, or to change the diamond in the
rough to the brilliant sparkling gem.</p>

<p>"As to the idea that the Christian bears
any part of the penalty of his sins&mdash;atoning for
them by his own suffering, or his works, or in
any other way, either in this life or the next,&mdash;it
is totally unscriptural. 'For Christ is the
end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth.'"</p>

<p>"O, thank you, so much, so very much!"
she exclaimed, looking up gratefully. "What
wonderful love His was, and who would not be
willing to bear any suffering to be made like
unto Him?"</p>

<p>"That is unquestionably a Christian spirit,"
said Mrs. Keith; "none but those who have
felt the burden of sin and learned to hunger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and thirst after righteousness know that ardent
desire for conformity to His image."</p>

<p>"You make my heart glad!" cried the girl.
"Damaris just told me there was no Christian
spirit about me; and I'm often afraid there
isn't; yet I do love Jesus and desire His love
more than anything else. I want to do and
suffer all His holy will!"</p>

<p>Little Mary Chetwood, a sweet child of six,
was the only daughter except Claudina, and
coming after some half dozen boys, naturally
became, from the first, a great pet and darling,
made much of by parents, sister and brothers.</p>

<p>Yet she was not a spoiled child; she had
been taught obedience, religiously trained, and
not indulged to her hurt.</p>

<p>Love and wise indulgence do no harm, but
quite the contrary; while harshness, a dearth
of affection, and undue severity have ruined
many a one for time and eternity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith found the Chetwoods a distressed
household; for though the little girl had
been but two days ill, such was the violence of
the attack that it was already apparent that
there was small hope of recovery.</p>

<p>"This is kind," whispered Mrs. Chetwood,
pressing her friend's hand, while tears coursed
down her cheeks. "The darling won't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
tended by any body but mother, father or sister,
but your very presence is a comfort."</p>

<p>"I should have been here sooner, but did
not know of her illness till this afternoon,"
Mrs. Keith responded in the same subdued
key. "If I can be of any use, I will take
off my bonnet and stay; it is perfectly convenient."</p>

<p>The offer was gratefully accepted, a note
dispatched to Mildred, entrusting the children
at home to her care till such time as her mother
could be of no more service at the squire's, and
Mrs. Keith's gentle ministries in the sick room
began.</p>

<p>Her quiet movements, her thoughtfulness,
quick comprehension and fertility of resource,
made her invaluable at such a time.</p>

<p>The end came sooner than was expected;
day was just breaking when, with her head
on the bosom of her who gave her birth, the
little one gently breathed her last.</p>

<p>In all the trying scenes that followed, Mr.
and Mrs. Keith and Mildred were most kind,
helpful and sympathizing, and the ties of Christian
friendship were thus more closely drawn
than ever between the two families.</p>

<p>The bereaved family found their home
sadly desolated, but there was no murmuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
against the Hand that dealt the blow; the
language of their hearts was, "The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
blessed be the name of the Lord."</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-second.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"Hail! independence, hail! heaven's next best gift,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To that of life, and an immortal soul."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomson.</span></span><br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">"There is strength,</span><br />
Deep bedded in our hearts, of which we reck<br />
But little till the shafts of heaven have pierc'd<br />
Its fragile dwelling. Must not earth be rent<br />
Before her gems are found?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. Hemans.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Boom</span>!"</p>

<p>The loud voice of the cannon rent the air
with sudden shock just as eager waiting eyes
caught the first glimpse of the sun's bright
disc peeping above the eastern horizon.</p>

<p>The sound broke suddenly in upon many a
dream, woke many a sleeper.</p>

<p>"Independence day! the glorious Fourth,
the nation's birthday," shouted Cyril, giving
Don a kick, then springing out of bed and hurrying
on his clothes.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! Fourth of July!" echoed Don,
following suit. "I'm so glad, 'cause now we
can fire our crackers."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Their clatter and another shot roused Fan
and Annis who joined in the rejoicing, the latter
calling loudly for mother or Milly to come
and dress her.</p>

<p>"No more hope of sleep," yawned Mr.
Keith, in the next room; "so we may as well
get up."</p>

<p>"Yes," returned his wife, "I wish you
would, and watch over the children;&mdash;see that
they don't burn their fingers or set things on
fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, Annis, mother's coming."</p>

<p>Breakfast was prepared amid the almost
constant firing of crackers and childish shouts
of exultation, near at hand, and the occasional
booming of the more distant cannon.</p>

<p>The young folks were full of gayety and
excitement, hurrahing, singing "Hail Columbia!"
"Yankee Doodle," and "Star-spangled
Banner."</p>

<p>Rupert came in a little late to breakfast,
from a stroll down town, and reported that a
wonderfully large flag-staff had been planted in
front of the court-house, and that the stars and
stripes were floating from its top.</p>

<p>The Sunday schools were to unite and
march in procession through the streets of the
town, then separate, and each school betake itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to its own church, there to enjoy a little
feast prepared by the parents and friends of the
scholars.</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of baking going
on in Mrs. Keith's kitchen the day before, and
shortly after breakfast a large basket was packed
with delicacies and sent to the church.</p>

<p>Then mother and Mildred had their hands
full for an hour or so in dressing the children
and themselves for the grand occasion.</p>

<p>They made a goodly show as they issued
from the gate and took their way toward the
place of rendezvous; the girls all in white muslin
and blue ribbons, the boys in their neat
Sunday suits, and each with a flower or tiny
nosegay in his button-hole.</p>

<p>The house had to be shut up, as Celestia
Ann claimed the holiday, but was left in its
usual neat and orderly condition, by means of
early rising and extra exertion on the part of
the three older girls. Otherwise Mildred
could not have been content to go, and delay
was dangerous, as on account of the heat of the
weather the procession was to move by nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>The whole town was in holiday attire, and
everywhere smiling faces were seen.</p>

<p>A shower in the night had laid the dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
without turning it to mud, and the Sunday
school celebration proved quite a success.</p>

<p>The children enjoyed their treat of cakes,
candies and lemonade, then the little Keiths
went home, tired enough to be glad to sit down
and rest while father, mother and Milly told
them stories of other Fourths that they could
remember.</p>

<p>After dinner Mildred went to call on her
friend Claudina, carrying with her another
book for Effie Prescott.</p>

<p>"Dunallan," had been returned in perfect
condition and with a little note of thanks.</p>

<p>Effie met Mildred with a pleased look, a
cheerful greeting, and warm thanks for the book.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you!" she said, "and
it was very kind in you to come; for I am
owing you a call. I thought I should have
paid it long ago, but there are so many days
when I don't feel quite equal to the walk."</p>

<p>"You do walk out then?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! every day when the weather is
good. That is part of the cure. But I cannot
walk fast or far."</p>

<p>"I hope you are improving."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so, but very slowly. I'm
never confined to bed, but never able to do
much, and the books are such a blessing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>From that they fell into talk about books
and authors and were mutually pleased to find
their tastes were similar as regarded literature,
and that their religious views accorded.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a friendship which
became a source of great enjoyment to both.</p>

<p>Effie had learned to love Mrs. Keith. That
drew Mildred toward her; and their common
faith in Christ and love to Him, was a yet
stronger bond of union.</p>

<p>They regretted that they had been so long
comparative strangers, and Mildred felt well rewarded
for the kind thoughtfulness on her part,
which had at length brought them together.</p>

<p>But leaving Effie to the perusal of the book,
she walked on to Squire Chetwood's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood and Claudina, in their deep
mourning dress, sat quietly at home, with no
heart to join in the mirth and jollity going on
about them; yet calm and resigned.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed the mother, tears springing to
her eyes, as the joyous shouts of children penetrated
to their silent room, "our little darling
would have been so gay and happy to-day! But
why do I say that! I know she is far, far happier
in that blessed land than she could ever
possibly have been here."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Claudina, weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
"and I do rejoice in the thought of her blessedness;
but oh, the house is so dreary and desolate
without her! O Mildred, how rich you are
with four sisters!"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the street door, answered
by the girl, and the next moment Miss
Drybread walked into the parlor where the
ladies were sitting.</p>

<p>She was courteously received and invited to
take a seat; which she did, drawing a deep
sigh.</p>

<p>"Are you well, Miss Damaris?" asked Mrs.
Chetwood.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm always well; I try and do right,
and have no sick fancies; am never troubled
with the vapors. I hope you're well?"</p>

<p>"As usual, thank you."</p>

<p>"You've had a great affliction."</p>

<p>No response, for the torn hearts could scarce
endure the rude touch; her tone was so cold
and hard.</p>

<p>"I hope you're resigned," she went on.
"You know we ought to be; especially considering
that we deserve all our troubles and
trials."</p>

<p>"I trust we are," said Mrs. Chetwood, "we
can rejoice in her happiness while we weep for
ourselves."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you think you made an idol of that
child? I think you did, and that that is the
reason why she was taken; for God won't allow
idols."</p>

<p>"We loved her very dearly," sobbed the
bereaved mother, "but I do not think we made
an idol of her, or ever indulged her to her hurt."</p>

<p>"The heart is deceitful," observed the
schoolma'am with emphasis, "and putting on
mourning, and shedding so many tears, doesn't
look like submission and resignation. I don't
see how a Christian can act so."</p>

<p>"Wait till you are bereaved," replied the
mother, sobs almost choking her utterance.</p>

<p>"And remember how Jesus wept at the
tomb of Lazarus, and that he never reproved the
Jews for putting on sackcloth and ashes when
mourning for their dead," said Mildred, adding,
in her uncontrollable indignation, "I think
you might be at better work, Miss Drybread,
than wrenching the hearts of these bereaved
ones whom Jesus loves, and in all whose afflictions
He is afflicted."</p>

<p>"I'm only doing my duty," retorted the
spinster; "the Bible says we must reprove our
brethren and not suffer sin upon them."</p>

<p>"It says 'Judge not, that ye be not judged.'
They are the words of Jesus in the Sermon on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the Mount, and if you turn to the passage and
read on a little further, you will see that people
who try to pull the mote out of a brother's eye
while there is a beam in their own, He calls
hypocrites."</p>

<p>"I can understand an insinuation as well as
the next one," said Miss Drybread, rising in
wrath, "and let me tell you, Miss, that I consider
you the most impertinent young person I
ever met.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mrs. and Miss Chetwood;
I wish you joy of your friend," and she swept
from the room and the house, before the astonished
ladies could utter a word.</p>

<p>"What a disagreeable, self-righteous old
hypocrite!" cried Mildred, her cheeks flushed,
her eyes flashing. "To think of her talking to
you in that cold-hearted, cruel manner, Mrs.
Chetwood and Claudina. But there! I am
judging her. Oh dear! oh dear!"</p>

<p>She finished with a burst of sobs, clasping her
arms about her friend, who was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood, too, was shedding tears;
but presently wiped them away, saying, "We
will try to forgive and forget her harsh words.
I trust she is a well-meaning, and perhaps, truly
good woman; though mistaken as to her duty
and sadly wanting in tact."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>On her way home Mildred passed Mr.
Lightcap's. She usually avoided doing so by
taking the other street; but to-day was too full
of grief for her bereaved friends, to care which
way her steps were tending till they were arrested
by Mrs. Lightcap's voice, speaking from
her open door.</p>

<p>"Why, if it ain't Miss Keith! I hain't seen
a sight o' you this long time. Walk in, won't
you? and sit a bit. They've all run off somewheres
and left me settin' here without a soul
to speak to, and I'm dreadful lonesome."</p>

<p>Mildred could not well refuse the invitation,
so stepped in and took a seat.</p>

<p>Her first feeling on becoming aware that
Mrs. Lightcap was addressing her was one of
embarrassment at the idea of facing the mother
of her rejected suitor; but the next instant she
concluded from the cordial manner of her neighbor,
that she must be entirely ignorant of the
affair, which was really the case; Gotobed
having insisted upon Rhoda Jane keeping his
secret.</p>

<p>Mildred was not in a talking mood, but Mrs.
Lightcap grew garrulous over the day's celebration,
the heat of the weather,&mdash;prophesying
that if it lasted long, coming as it did after a
very rainy spring, there would be a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of sickness&mdash;branching off finally to her housework
and garden; two inexhaustible themes
with her.</p>

<p>An occasional yes, or no, or nod of acquiescence,
was all that was necessary on the part of
her listener; and these Mildred could supply
without giving her undivided attention to the
steady flow of empty talk.</p>

<p>The firing of the cannon at short intervals
had been kept up all day. "Boom!" it came
now, causing Mrs. Lightcap to give a sudden
start and break off in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" she exclaimed, "I can't
git used to that there firin'; and I jest wisht
they'd stop it; 'fore some on 'em gits hurt. It's
a dreadful dangerous thing&mdash;gunpowder is, and
I guess there ain't never a Fourth when there
don't somebody git about half killed."</p>

<p>"Or quite," said Mildred; "people will
be so careless; and I suppose that even with
the greatest care there must be some danger,
from the bursting of guns and other accidents
that it is, perhaps, impossible to guard against."</p>

<p>Mildred sat very near the open door, Mrs.
Lightcap farther within the room.</p>

<p>"Well as I was a sayin'," began the latter,
resuming the thread of her discourse.</p>

<p>Some one came running without, his heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
footsteps resounding upon the sidewalk. It
was a man. He paused before the door, looking
pale and frightened, and beckoning to Mildred,
said in a low, hurried tone, "Just step this
way a minute, Miss, I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>Hardly comprehending, too much taken by
surprise even to wonder what he could want,
she hastily complied.</p>

<p>"She ought to be prepared, you know," he
went on in the same breathless, agitated manner,
drawing her further away from the door as
he spoke; "he's awfully hurt, a'most killed, I
believe, and they're bringin' him up the street
now."</p>

<p>"Who?" gasped Mildred.</p>

<p>"Her son Gote; gun went off while he was
ramming in the wadding and shot the ramrod
right through his hands; I guess they'll both
have to come off."</p>

<p>Mildred staggered back, sick and faint, and
with a dazed sort of feeling that she was somehow
to blame.</p>

<p>"They're comin'," repeated the man hurriedly,
pointing to a little crowd of men and
boys moving slowly up the street, scarcely a
square away, "can't you say something to her!
kind o' break the shock a little, you know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lightcap had stepped into the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
way and was looking this way and that, curious
to learn the cause of Mildred's sudden exit.</p>

<p>"Why, Jim Foote, is that you?" she exclaimed.
"What on airth are you a wantin'
with Miss Keith?" then catching sight of the
approaching crowd, "What's goin' on?" she
asked, "anything the matter?"</p>

<p>Mildred sprang to her side, and fairly pushing
her back into the house, threw her arms
about her sobbing, "Oh, I'm so sorry for you!
so sorry! Don't look! not yet. He&mdash;he's
living but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who? who's a livin'? who's hurt? Girl,
tell me quick! 'Tain't none o' mine, sure?
'Taint my old man? Oh, what'll I do? what'll
I do?"</p>

<p>The trampling of many feet drew near, her
husband rushed in, pale, breathless, trembling,
and at sight of her burst out crying like a
child. Then the wounded man was supported
into the house, men and boys, and even women
and girls crowding in after, till in a moment
the room was full.</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane and the younger brothers and
sisters were there, screaming and crying. Gotobed
was silent, bearing his agony with the
heroism of a soldier, but as his mother caught
sight of his ghastly face, his mangled hands, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
blood upon his person, and the surgeon with
his instruments, she uttered a wild shriek and
fell back fainting.</p>

<p>Her husband carried her into the kitchen,
and some of the neighbor women gathered
round with restoratives and whispered words
of pity and condolence, while others hurried
back and forth in quest of such articles as the
surgeon called for.</p>

<p>Rhoda Jane rushed out of the kitchen door,
and ran to the foot of the garden, screaming
and wringing her hands, the younger ones following
her.</p>

<p>Mildred could not go away and leave the
family in their dire distress. She caught
Gotobed's eye, and there was in it a dumb entreaty
which she had neither power nor heart
to resist.</p>

<p>Silently she made her way to his side.
The doctors were clearing the room of all who
were not needed.</p>

<p>"They're a goin' to take off my right hand,"
he said hoarsely. "It's an awful thing, but if&mdash;if
you'll stand by me and let me look in your
eyes, I can bear it."</p>

<p>She turned hers on the surgeon&mdash;Lucilla
Grange's father.</p>

<p>"May I?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you have the nerve, my dear child; it
would be a great kindness to the poor fellow.
There ought to be a woman near him, and it
seems neither mother nor sister is equal to it."</p>

<p>"I will stay," she said, a great compassion
filling her heart. "I shall not look at what you
are doing; but I will stand by and fan him."</p>

<p>She kept her word; forgetting herself entirely,
thinking of him only as one suffering
terrible agony and in need of her support, she
stood gazing into his eyes, her heart going up
in silent, fervent prayer on his behalf.</p>

<p>Chloroform and ether were not known in
those days, and the knife's cruel work must be
borne without the blessed insensibility to pain
that they can give. Had the magnetism of
Mildred's gaze a like effect? I know not; but
something enabled Gotobed to pass through the
terrible ordeal without a groan or moan; almost
without flinching.</p>

<p>The right hand had to be taken off at the
wrist; the left, though much mangled, the surgeon
hoped to save; and did so ultimately.</p>

<p>The amputation and the dressing of the
wounds was over at last and Mildred was turning
away when a cup of tea was put into her
hand with the words, spoken in a half whisper,
"Give him this; he will take it from you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>She held it to his lips and he drank; a plate
was silently substituted for the cup and she fed
him like a child.</p>

<p>Poor fellow! it would be long before he
could feed himself again.</p>

<p>Mildred set down the plate and stole quickly
from the house. Her long pent up emotion
must find vent.</p>

<p>She went weeping home, her heart breaking
with pity for the man she could not love,
could not have married for the wealth of the
world. Oh, why did he love her so?</p>

<p>She had read it in his eyes;&mdash;that she was
more to him than all the world beside, and that
he knew his was a hopeless passion.</p>

<p>She was glad to see that the sun was setting;
because she knew from the lateness of
the hour that tea must be over at home, and
the little ones in bed; for she dreaded their
questionings and curious looks, and loathed
the thought of food.</p>

<p>Her mother, that best earthly friend, who
always understood her as by intuition, met her
at the door and clasped her in a tender, loving
embrace; and on that dear bosom the whole
sad story was sobbed out.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor fellow! my heart aches for
him," Mrs. Keith said, mingling her tears with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Mildred's. "And, my dear child I am very
glad you had the courage and firmness to give
him the help you did. I pity him, too, for his
unfortunate attachment, at the same time that
I, of course, could never, never be willing to
see it returned.</p>

<p>"But your courage surprises me, I doubt
if I should be capable of the like myself," she
added, smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>"I know you would, mother dear," returned
the girl, gazing with loving admiration into her
mother's eyes; "for you are far braver and
firmer than I. I should not have expected to
be able to do it myself, but we never know
what we can do till we are tried.</p>

<p>"I am sure our Father helped me in answer
to prayer, and according to his gracious
promise, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength
be,'" she added in subdued, tremulous tones.</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it," said Mrs. Keith; "for
'our sufficiency is of God.'"</p>

<p>Throughout the whole town great sympathy
was felt for the wounded young man.
People showed it in various ways; by inquiries
made of the doctor or at the door, by calling in
for a little friendly chat and sending delicacies
to tempt his appetite; which for a time failed
under the pressure of pain, enforced idleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
(a great change for one who had been all his
life a hard worker) and depression of spirits;
for there were seasons when he was well-nigh
overwhelmed at the thought of his maimed and
helpless condition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith went frequently to see and
comfort him and his distressed mother, and was
more successful in so doing than almost any
one else; except Mildred, who occasionally accompanied
her.</p>

<p>They carried to Gotobed food for the mind
as well as the body; books which they read to
him; as he could not hold them himself, and
the other members of the family had little time
or ability to entertain him in that way.</p>

<p>Also they said many a kind, encouraging
word concerning the possibilities of future usefulness
yet remaining to him.</p>

<p>"I shall never be good for nothing no
more," he sighed, mournfully, one day, looking
down at his maimed arm and wounded hand;
"can never swing my hammer, or shoe a horse
again. I'll have to be a helpless burden on
other folks, 'stead o' takin' care o' father and
mother when they git old, as I used to think I
should."</p>

<p>"I don't know that, Gotobed," Mrs. Keith
answered cheerily; "I think God has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
you a good mind, and that you will gradually
learn to do a great deal with that left hand;
write, hold a book and turn the leaves, and so
be able to educate yourself for usefulness in
some new line; perhaps do more for your
parents and friends than you ever could have
done with your hammer."</p>

<p>A light broke over his face at her words,
"Oh!" he said drawing a long breath, "if I
thought that I could bear it."</p>

<p>"I think you are bearing it bravely," she
said.</p>

<p>"I'm tryin' my best," he sighed, "but the
Lord only knows how hard it is; 'specially when
folks comes and tells you it's a judgment sent
onto you for your sins."</p>

<p>"And who dares to tell you that?" she
cried, flushing with indignation, "who could be
so heartlessly cruel?"</p>

<p>"Well, Damaris was in t'other day. She
means well enough, I guess;&mdash;she fetched
something she'd cooked up for me&mdash;but she
don't seem to understand a feller critter's feelin's.
She give me a long lecture; said I'd
been dreadful proud o' my strength and what
a neat job I could make o' shoein' a horse and
the like, and so that the Lord took away my
hand to punish me and fetch me down. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
you think 'twas that way, Mis' Keith? I was
thinkin' 'twas my own carelessness and not to
be blamed on Him at all."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that you are very nearly
right there," she replied, half smiling at the
earnest simplicity with which he spoke. "He
is very merciful and gracious, full of tender pity
and compassion for the creatures He has made;
especially those who are peculiarly His own because
they have accepted of the salvation offered
through Christ Jesus; yet He does not always
see fit to save them from the consequences, as
regards this life, of their own follies and sins."</p>

<p>"Carelessness is a sin," he said with a heavy
sigh. "I didn't use to think so, but it's plain
enough to me now. And do you think, Mis'
Keith, He feels kind o' sorry for me even
though 'twas my own fault?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it; and that He will give
you strength to bear your trouble if you will
ask Him; to bear it bravely and not let it spoil
your life by robbing you of cheerfulness and
hope, and the usefulness you may attain to by
a determined, manly struggle with your difficulties.</p>

<p>"There is a pleasure in overcoming difficulties,"
she added with a bright, winning smile,
that was like a ray of sunlight to his saddened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
heart, "a pleasure that the slothful know
nothing of."</p>

<p>"I'll try it!" he said with determination.
"God helping me, I will. Bless you, Mis'
Keith, fur them words. I'll not forget 'em."</p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Third.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"The sad vicissitudes of things."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sterne.</span></span><br />
</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> poor, dear friend, would that I could
comfort you!" Mrs. Keith said in tones of deep
heartfelt sympathy, folding her arms about Mrs.
Chetwood and weeping with her; "but only
Jesus can do that in such sorrow as yours."</p>

<p>"And He does, else I should die; for oh my
arms are so empty, my heart and home so desolate!"
sobbed the bereaved mother.</p>

<p>"I know it, I know it by sad experience;
for I too, have wept over the grave of a darling
little one."</p>

<p>"You?" Mrs. Chetwood said with a look of
surprise; "you have so many."</p>

<p>"Yes; but then I had not all I have now.
Eva was between Rupert and Zillah and would
be thirteen now. She was five when God took
her to himself."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do know how to feel for me!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and let me tell you how I was comforted.
I fear I was not quite submissive at
first; but a dear old mother in Israel, who had
several times passed through the same deep
waters, came to me and said 'My dear, the
Lord gave you quite a little flock and when He
comes and asks you to return him one, and you
know He will keep it so safely in his kind arms
and on his tender bosom, will you refuse? can
you not spare Him one?'</p>

<p>"Then my heart was almost broken to think
I had been so churlish toward my beloved Master
and I resigned her cheerfully into His care,
and by and by grew happy in thinking of her,
so safe from all sin and sorrow and pain, so full
of joy, at His right hand; and of the time when
my work shall be done and I shall go to her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood thought for a moment, then
turning to her friend with eyes brimful of tears,
"Thank you," she said, "your words have done
me good. Surely I too, can spare Him one.
Had He taken all, what right could I have to
complain? and oh, how sweet is the thought
that He is caring so tenderly for my precious
lambkin!"</p>

<p>The mothers mingled their tears again for a
little, tears of blended grief and joy; then Mrs.
Chetwood said "What else dear friend? I seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
to read in your eyes that you have something
more to say to me."</p>

<p>"Only this, suggested to me by the same
old Christian soldier and confirmed by my own
experience; that efforts to comfort others react
upon ourselves, so proving the best panacea for
our own sorrow."</p>

<p>"I believe it, am conscience-smitten that I
have been so selfishly wrapped up in my own
grief, and shall set about the work at once.
Will you do me the favor to suggest where I
shall begin?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith spoke of Gotobed and the sort of
comfort and assistance of which he stood in
need.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood shuddered. "Poor, poor
fellow!" she said; "my heart aches for him.
I feel sick at the very thought of seeing any one
in that mutilated condition, but I will go to him
and do what I can for his comfort and relief."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Mrs. Keith heartily
"And speak comfortingly to the poor mother.
She is grieving very much for him, and does
not look well. One of the little girls, too, is
quite ill with intermittent fever."</p>

<p>It was well that Mrs. Keith had engaged
her friend to take up the labor of love, for it
was long before she herself could resume it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
On reaching home she found Mildred sitting
with Annis in her arms, the little creature
moaning with pain and in a high fever.</p>

<p>"Mother, she is very sick," whispered Mildred
tremulously, her eyes full of tears; for she
was thinking of how suddenly Mary Chetwood
had been snatched away by the grim destroyer
Death.</p>

<p>"I fear she is, poor darling! poor little pet!"
the mother said, bending over her and softly
pressing her lips to the burning cheek.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother, if we should lose her!"</p>

<p>"We will do all we can to make her well,
asking God's blessing on our efforts," Mrs.
Keith answered with determined cheerfulness,
though a sharp pang shot through her heart at
the bare suggestion.</p>

<p>Dr. Grange was sent for at once. He pronounced
the child very ill, but by no means
hopelessly so.</p>

<p>"The sickly season," he remarked, "is setting
in unusually early and with uncommon
severity, both in town and country; people are
taken down with the fever every day. But it
is what I have been expecting as the result of
the long heavy rains we had all through the
spring, succeeded by this intensely hot, dry
weather. Why we haven't had a drop of rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
now, scarcely a cloud, for three weeks; the
heavens above us are as brass, and the marshes
and pools of stagnant water on every side are
teeming with miasma.</p>

<p>"Keep the children and yourselves out of
the sun during the heat of the day, and do not
on any account allow them to be exposed to
the night air and dew."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your suggestions," said
Mr. Keith, "we will do our best to follow
them."</p>

<p>He had just come home from his office; for
it was near tea-time. The children too had
come in from their work or play, and the whole
family were gathered in the sitting-room, where
the baby girl lay in her cradle, mother and sister
hanging over her in tender solicitude.</p>

<p>Fan had climbed her father's knee and was
lying very quiet in his arms with her head on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The doctor taking his hat to go, paused as
his eye fell on her, and stepping quickly to her
side, took her hand in his.</p>

<p>"This child is sick too," he said, and went
on to question and prescribe for her, directing
that she should be put to bed at once.</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed Mildred, "if we only had
Aunt Wealthy here!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you had," the doctor said; "but
the neighbors here are always very kind in
times of sickness."</p>

<p>"Yes; we have had experience of that in
the past," replied Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>The doctor called on Mrs. Chetwood and
Mrs. Prior on his homeward way, and within
an hour both were at Mr. Keith's offering their
services in nursing or any thing else that was
needed.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Mrs. Keith said,
"but I think we can manage for a while, and
that you should save your strength for those
who need it more."</p>

<p>The little ones objected to being waited
upon by strangers, and Celestia Ann insisted
that she wanted no help with her housework
or cooking; so the ladies departed after exacting
a promise that they should be sent for if
needed.</p>

<p>That time came soon; before the crisis was
passed with Annis and Fan, three more of the
children, Zillah, Cyril, and Don, were taken
down; then the father; and oh, what a weary
burden of care, anxiety, toil and grief fell upon
the mother and sister! They had sore need
now of all the faith, patience and hope they
had garnered up in happier days; of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
great and precious promises they had learned
to lean upon.</p>

<p>Rupert was slowly dressing himself one
August morning, feeling weak and ill, when his
mother's pale, sorrowful face looked in at his door.</p>

<p>He tried to brighten up and seem strong
and well as he turned to meet her, asking,
"How are you, mother dear? and the sick
ones? I hope you all slept."</p>

<p>"Not much," she said, vainly striving after
the accustomed cheery tone. "Annis and Fan
did pretty well (oh, I am thankful that the
doctor considers them out of danger now, if we
can only give them the good nursing they
need,) but poor Cyril is quite delirious, very,
very sick, I fear, and Zillah not much better.
Besides&mdash;" but here her voice broke, and for a
moment she was unable to go on.</p>

<p>"O mother, not another one down?" he
cried, "You and Mildred will be killed with
so much nursing."</p>

<p>"Rupert, it is your father now," she sobbed.
"He tries to makes us believe it is not much;
that he'll sleep it off in an hour or so, but oh, I
can see that he's very sick."</p>

<p>"My father very sick," he echoed, aghast;
"poor father! and you must lose his help with
the others, and have him to nurse, too!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is not the worst of it. He is suffering
and perhaps in danger. Celestia Ann has
breakfast nearly ready. I want you to eat at
once then go for the doctor (he did not come
last night) and call and tell Mrs. Chetwood and
Mrs. Prior what a sick household we are and
that now if they can give me help in nursing,
I shall be very glad and thankful."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith passed on into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Breakfast's on table," said Celestia Ann.
"You just sit down and eat, Mis' Keith; fur
you look ready to drop. I'll pour you out a
cup o' coffee, and then run in and look after
the sick till you're done."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Mrs. Keith said, "though I
have no desire for food, I will accept your offer,
for I do feel faint and empty. Tell Mildred to
come too, as soon as she can be spared."</p>

<p>Rupert and Ada came in together at that
moment and took their places at the table.</p>

<p>"Only three of us this morning, 'stead of
ten," Ada remarked sadly.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll hope the others will all be back
soon;" said Rupert, longing to comfort and
cheer his mother.</p>

<p>His head ached and chills were creeping
down his back, but he said nothing about it,
drank his coffee, forced himself to eat a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and presently declaring himself done, put on
his hat and hurried away on his errand.</p>

<p>It was now a fortnight since Annis had
been taken ill and not a drop of rain had fallen
yet. The nights and mornings were chilly and
damp, then the sun rose and shone all day with
a fierce, burning heat that scorched everything
it touched; and day by day the fever had found
new victims till every physician's hands were
full to overflowing.</p>

<p>"How chilly it is!" thought Rupert, as he
hastened down the path to the gate, "but it'll
be hot enough presently," he added, looking up
at the sky; "not a cloud to be seen, and the sun
will be glaring down on us as fiercely as ever.
I think if there isn't some change soon we'll all
sicken and die."</p>

<p>He walked on up the street. Doors and
windows were closed; scarcely any one seemed
astir.</p>

<p>"They're sleeping late," he thought
"Well who can blame them? they're either
sick themselves or worn out taking care of the
sick."</p>

<p>He came first to the hotel. Mrs. Prior was
very busy getting breakfast, but stepped to the
door to hear his message.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadful sorry;" she said, "and I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
call round, tell your mother, just as soon as I
can; but I've half a dozen boarders down with
the fever, and only one girl; the rest's all gone
off to 'tend to their own folks; for the fever's
bad all round in the country; and between
them and the town folks the doctors is goin'
night and day."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can come at all then,
Mrs. Prior," Rupert said, "I should think your
hands must be more than full here at home."</p>

<p>"I'll come if I can, you may depend," she
answered, "for I think a sight of your mother."</p>

<p>The boy sighed heavily as he turned and
went on his way. How much of the brightness
seemed to have gone out of life just then.</p>

<p>Dr. Grange's house was a few steps further
on. An old lady, the doctor's mother, answered
his knock.</p>

<p>"The doctor is in bed and asleep just now,"
she said. "He has had very little rest for the
last three weeks, was up all night out in the
country, and came home with a heavy chill.
And the rest of the family are all down with
the fever except myself and little five year old
Ellen."</p>

<p>"What are we coming to!" exclaimed the
lad.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered: "but God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
is our refuge and strength; a very present help
in trouble!'"</p>

<p>"I do not know what to do," said Rupert,
looking sadly perplexed and anxious; "mother
says my father and Cyril are both very ill."</p>

<p>"I will tell the doctor when he wakes, and
perhaps he will be able to go down. It would
hardly be worth while to send you for another,
for they're all equally busy."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, "we would not like
to have to try another," and bidding her good
morning, he went on his way to the Squire's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood put on her bonnet at once
and went with him.</p>

<p>"Claudina would come too," she said, "but
two of the boys are sick, and I'm afraid she is
taking the fever herself."</p>

<p>"It seems as if everybody is taking it," said
Rupert. "Mrs. Chetwood, is it often so sickly
here?"</p>

<p>"Never was known to be quite so bad before,"
she answered; "they say the oldest inhabitant
doesn't remember such a time. Do
you notice how quiet and empty the streets
are?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am; people seem to be very late
in getting up. The stores are all shut up still."</p>

<p>"There's no business doing at all," she returned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
"and people are not up because they're
ill; too ill, most of them, to leave their beds.</p>

<p>"There are not many houses in town where
more than one or two are able to crawl about
to help themselves or wait on the sick.</p>

<p>"And Dr. Grange tells me it is just as bad in
the country. The harvest is uncommonly fine,
but there's nobody to gather it in; there are
loads of wild berries ripe on the bushes, but
nobody able to pick them.</p>

<p>"Emmaretta Lightcap died yesterday; I was
there last night and helped to lay her out. All
the rest of the family are in bed with the fever,
except poor Gotobed and his mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a sorrowful time! Effie and one
or two of the little ones are sick at Mr. Prescott's,
and in the next house not one of the
family is able to be out of bed."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was quite as ill as his wife feared.</p>

<p>She devoted herself principally to him,
while Mrs. Chetwood and Mildred together
nursed the others.</p>

<p>Rupert had had a chill and fever followed
in due season; but he managed to keep up and
to conceal his illness from all but Celestia Ann,
who did the best she could for him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prior came in for an hour in the after
noon, and taking Mildred's place enabled her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
lie down for a little greatly needed rest and
sleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chetwood spent the day and night
with them, but then went home to return no
more, her own family being no longer able to
dispense with her care and nursing.</p>

<p>Zillah was slightly better that morning, but
Mr. Keith, Cyril and Don were all delirious
and so evidently in danger that the hearts of
mother and sister were very heavy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith scarcely left her husband's bed
side except occasionally to pass into the next
room and bend for a moment over her little
boys, to take Annis or Fan in her arms to
caress, and reluctantly put them down again, and
to whisper a word of hope and encouragement
to Mildred, the other little girls and Rupert.</p>

<p>Celestia Ann had full sway in the kitchen,
and with genuine kindness of heart took charge
of the rest of the house, so far as she could, and
prepared delicacies for the sick.</p>

<p>She was a great help in looking after the
convalescing, had always a cheery word ready
for the weary, anxious nurses, and in short
proved herself invaluable in this great emergency.</p>

<p>What then was their distress and despair
when they found they must lose her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing from the window on the morning
of the second day after that which Mrs. Chetwood
had spent with them, Mildred saw a
countryman passing round toward the kitchen,
and in a moment after his voice and Celestia
Ann's could be heard in earnest colloquy, the
latter interrupted by heavy sobs.</p>

<p>Then she appeared at the door of the
nursery with her apron to her eyes and
silently beckoned to Mildred.</p>

<p>"What is it?" the latter asked going to her.</p>

<p>"Why my brother's come to fetch me home,
and I'll have to go, bad as I hate to leave you;
for if I do say it that shouldn't, I don't see how
you're agoin' to git along without me."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Mildred, aghast. "O, Celestia
Ann, must you go?"</p>

<p>"Yes; can't help it; for they're all down
with the fever, 'cept mother (and she's poorly)
and this brother that's come after me; and he's
got a chill on him now. So I'll have to pick
up my duds and be off right away."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you must go to your own
when they need you," said Mildred; "unless
they could get some one else. O, Celestia Ann,
don't you think it possible they could?"</p>

<p>"No; I know they can't, Miss Mildred;
there's no help to be got these days for love or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
money; and the Lord only knows what's to become
of us all!</p>

<p>"Sam says there's several died in our neighborhood
a'ready, just for want o' good nussin
and proper victuals; so the doctor says."</p>

<p>"And just so it will be with us," sobbed Mildred
sinking into a chair and covering her face
with her hands. "I cannot nurse them all properly,
and cook what they need to eat; and oh, it is
so terrible to think they must die for want of it."</p>

<p>"It's awful, and I'm dreadful sorry for you
and everybody," sighed Celestia Ann, wiping
away the tears that were streaming over her
cheeks. "Maybe you might git Mis' Rood to
come in for a few days. I'll git Sam to go and
see while I'm a pickin' up my things.</p>

<p>"She ain't much for cookin' I don't suppose,
but she could clean up and do that big
washin', and help a liftin' the sick ones. That
is if she'll come; but I dunno but she may be
down sick herself."</p>

<p>Sam kindly undertook the errand, but alas,
Mrs. Rood was "down sick herself," and no
help could be had from that quarter, nor apparently,
from any other; and with many tears
Celestia Ann took her departure, saying, "I'll
come back as soon as I kin, if I keep well, and
my folks gits able to do without me."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Fourth.</h2>

<div class='center'>
"Calamity is man's true touch stone."<br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was to Mildred Celestia Ann's parting
words were spoken, Mildred sitting in dumb
despair beside the bed, where Cyril and Don
lay tossing and moaning in a burning fever.
Her heart sank like lead in her bosom, as she
listened to the rumbling of the wheels of the
wagon that was bearing away her late efficient
helper. "What could they do without her?"</p>

<p>A quiet step crossed the room, a soft hand
was laid caressingly on Mildred's bowed head,
and looking up she saw her mother's sweet, pale
face bending over her; a worn and weary face,
but with a strange peacefulness shining through
its care and sorrow.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother, whatever shall we do?"
cried the girl in a broken whisper, and with a
burst of tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith had a small Bible in her hand,
her finger between the leaves. She laid it open
before Mildred, pointed to a passage in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
sixty-second psalm, and just touching her lips
to her daughter's forehead, turned away to the
little sufferers on the bed.</p>

<p>"Mother's darlings! mother's poor little
men! Try to be very patient and good like the
dear Lord Jesus when he was in pain, and
mother hopes you will soon be well again.
She is asking Jesus to make you well."</p>

<p>"I wish he would," moaned Cyril, while;
Don uttered some incoherent words, showing
that his mind wandered.</p>

<p>"I'se better, mamma," piped the baby voice
of Annis from another bed. "Fan and me's
better. I dess Dod will make us well, 'tause
we asked him to."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, don't fret about us," joined
in Fan and Zillah patiently.</p>

<p>She went over and kissed all three, calling
them "dear good children," then passed on into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Rupert was there trying to make a custard;
Ada washing dishes.</p>

<p>"You see you're not entirely without help
in this department yet, mother," the lad said
laughingly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered with a smile that he
felt was ample reward for his efforts, "how
are you succeeding?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bravely; at least it looks nice. Please
come and tell me if 'tis ready to be taken off."</p>

<p>"It will be in a moment. Run out and get
me a handful of leaves from that young peach
tree, to flavor it with."</p>

<p>He obeyed, she stirring the custard and commending
Ada's industry, while he was gone.</p>

<p>"Here they are, mother; is this enough?"
he asked, coming back.</p>

<p>"Quite," she said taking them from him;
then as her hand touched his, "Rupert," she
cried with anguish in her tones, "you are sick!
burning up with fever!"</p>

<p>"Heated over the stove, mother," he said,
trying to laugh it off, as he lifted the kettle
from the fire and poured its contents into a
bowl.</p>

<p>"No, I am not to be deceived," she answered
in a choking voice, "you ought to be in bed
now."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Somebody must
keep up; several somebodies to take anything
like proper care of the sick ones. And, mother,
I'm as able as you are; you look dreadfully
worn and ill."</p>

<p>She was all that; she felt the chills creeping
over her at that moment, and her head
seemed ready to burst; her heart also.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, she had need of all the comfort and
support of the words she had pointed out to
Mildred, and of the exhortation contained
therein.</p>

<p>"My soul, wait thou only upon God; for
my expectation is from him. He only is my
rock and my salvation; he is my defense, I
shall not be moved. In God is my salvation
and my glory; the rock of my strength and
my refuge is in God."</p>

<p>She whispered them to herself, as with
clasped hands and closed eyes, she sank heavily
into a chair, half unconscious of what she was
doing.</p>

<p>Rupert sprang to her side, thinking she
was about to faint, and Ada, with the same
thought in her mind, set down the plate she
was wiping and hurried to her also.</p>

<p>They caught the last words. "'The rock
of my strength and my refuge is in God.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, dear," sobbed the lad, putting
his arms around her, "and oh, you know
it's a refuge that will never fail. 'Therefore
will we not fear though the earth be removed
and though the mountains be carried into the
midst of the sea.' 'Man's extremity is God's
opportunity,' and He will help us through this
strait somehow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, "and though it
should be by death, what is that but going,
home? To those of us who love the Lord and
trust in His imputed righteousness," she added,
looking earnestly, questioningly into his face.</p>

<p>"Mother, I believe I do," he said, "though
I have never told you so before."</p>

<p>"Now I can bear it," she whispered, closing
her eyes again, while a sweet smile played
about her lips.</p>

<p>Her head dropped heavily on her son's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh," shrieked Ada, "she's dying! mother's
dying!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" cried Rupert sternly, thinking of
the mischief her cry might work should it reach
the ears of the sick ones, "she has only fainted.
A tumbler of water; quick, quick, Ada!"</p>

<p>As the terrified child hastened to do his
bidding, Mildred came flying from the inner
room, her face pale, her whole frame trembling
with affright.</p>

<p>"Mother!" the word came in tones of
agony from her pale, quivering lips.</p>

<p>"It's only a faint," said Rupert hoarsely.
"Help me to lay her down and loosen her
clothes. And haven't you hartshorn or something!
whatever there is.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Ada, quick, quick! the bottle of
smelling salts! it's on the stand by father's bedside.
O, mother, mother! you too! what's to
become of us? O, Rupert, she's just killed
with nursing! and I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't; you are nearly
killed yourself," he said, his tears falling almost
as fast as hers, while between them they half
carried, half dragged the insensible form into
the adjoining room and laid it tenderly down
upon a lounge.</p>

<p>Poor children! so utterly overwhelmed
were they by their mother's helpless condition,
superadded to all the other causes for anxiety,
perplexity and distress, so taken up with efforts
for her restoration to consciousness, that they
scarcely heard the cries of the sick little ones,
who could not understand why they were thus
left alone, or the calls of their father who had
roused from sleep and missed his gentle nurse;
nor did they notice who it was that came in
through the open kitchen door and silently assisted
them, raising the window blind and
sprinkling water on the still white face.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Keith's eyes unclosed and she
started up asking faintly "What is it? have I
been ill?" then fell back again completely exhausted.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were faint, mother dear," said Mildred,
vainly striving to steady her voice, "but
lie still for a while and I hope you will get over
it. You have been doing too much and must
rest now."</p>

<p>"Rest, child! how can I? There is your
father calling me. And the children are crying."</p>

<p>She started up again but with the same result
as before.</p>

<p>"My poor sick husband! my little ailing
children! what is to become of you?" she
sighed, tears stealing from beneath the closed
eyelids and trickling down the pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mother, I will do my best," sobbed Mildred;
"only lie and rest yourself."</p>

<p>"And I am here to assist, and able to do it,"
said a somewhat harsh, discordant voice, though
there was in it a tone of kindness too.</p>

<p>Then they looked up and saw standing near,
the stiff, angular figure of Damaris Drybread.</p>

<p>"You?" Mildred exclaimed in utter surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I, Miss Keith. Did you think there
was none of the milk of human kindness in me?
My school's broke up by this pestilence, and
only one of our family has took the fever yet;
so when I heard that you were nearly all down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
sick here, and your girl had gone off and left
you, I said to myself, 'There's a duty for you
there, Damaris Drybread; go right away and
do it,' And I came."</p>

<p>"And it was very, very kind in you," Mildred
said, extending her hand. "I have hardly
deserved it from you, for I've judged you,
harshly."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't wonder if I'd done the
same to you," Damaris answered coldly, taking
the offered hand only to drop it again instantly.
"But that's neither here nor there; and I don't
ask no thanks. I'm only tryin' to be a good
Samaritan to you, because we're told, 'Go, and
do thou likewise.'"</p>

<p>The cries of the children had become so
piteous and importunate that Mildred rushed
away to attend to them.</p>

<p>Her father's calls had ceased and as the little
ones quieted down she could hear a manly
voice speaking to him in gentle soothing tones.</p>

<p>"It is the doctor," she thought, with an
emotion somewhat akin to pleasure; he was so
sorely needed and had not called since the previous
night; but on going in she found Mr.
Lord by the bedside.</p>

<p>He turned, showing a face full of sympathy
and concern, and held out his hand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is kind," she said, putting hers
into it.</p>

<p>"My poor child!" he responded feelingly,
raising the hand to his lips in his absent way,
"my heart aches for you. And there are many
others in like affliction; many others! all round
the country people are sick, dying; many of
them simply for lack of suitable nourishment."</p>

<p>The tears rolled down his manly cheeks as
he spoke, and the sight of them did not lower
him in the girl's esteem.</p>

<p>"And what can I do?" he went on. "I
know nothing of cooking; I can only carry
them crackers to sustain their poor bodies, and
try to feed their souls with the bread of life. I
feel for them all; but for you&mdash;O, Mildred,
dear girl, what can I do to help and comfort
you in this extremity?"</p>

<p>"We have need of nurses. Mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>But with that word she broke into uncontrollable
weeping; suppressed, for fear of disturbing
her father, who had fallen into a doze&mdash;but
shaking her whole frame with its violence.</p>

<p>It distressed her listener. He made a step
toward her, a gesture as if he would fold her
in his arms, but drew hastily back, blushing
and confused as the door opened and Dr. Grange
came in.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter Twenty-Fifth</h2>

<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"All love is sweet,</span><br />

And its familiar voice wearies not ever."<br />

</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ah</span>, good morning, my dear child! Good
morning, sir," the doctor said in an undertone,
giving his hand to Mildred and the minister in
turn. Then with an anxious glance at the bed
"How is he? sleeping now, I see. How did
he rest through the night?"</p>

<p>"Not very well, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your mother? where is she? not down
too?" with almost a groan, as he read the truth
in the young girl's face.</p>

<p>Mildred led him to her. She lay on the
lounge still, with closed eyes and face of deathly
pallor, her cheek resting against the dark curls
of Rupert, who had thrown himself on the floor
by her side, and laid his head on the same pillow,
while he held one of her hands, caressing
it tenderly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>His cheeks were burning, his eyes sparkling
with fever.</p>

<p>The doctor glanced from one to the other.
"Ought to be in bed; both of you. Go my
boy, at once; you are not fit to be here."</p>

<p>"I can't, sir, indeed; I'm needed to take
care of the others."</p>

<p>"You will help most by giving up at once,"
said the doctor; "otherwise you will make
yourself so sick as to need a great deal of
attention."</p>

<p>"Yes, go, my dear boy," whispered Mrs.
Keith.</p>

<p>"I will, since you bid me, darling mother,"
he answered, pressing his hot lips to her cheek,
then tottering from the room.</p>

<p>She looked after him with sad, pitying
eyes, "So sick, and your mother not able to
nurse you! Mildred, my poor dear child, how
are you to stand it?" she sighed, turning them
upon her daughter's face as she bent over her.</p>

<p>"Try not to be troubled and anxious, my
dear madam," said the doctor, "the more quiet
and free from care you can keep your mind, the
better for you. Trust the Lord that all will
come out right."</p>

<p>"I will; he is all my hope and trust for
myself and for my dear ones," she answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>,
with almost her accustomed cheerfulness.
"Things look very dark but 'behold, the Lord's
hand is not shortened that it cannot save;
neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear.'"</p>

<p>"And he has sent us some help already,"
observed Mildred; "from a most unexpected
quarter."</p>

<p>Damaris came in at that moment from the
kitchen, saluted the doctor in her usual formal
way, and turning to Mrs. Keith, remarked,</p>

<p>"I hope you're not going to be very sick;
but you'd ought to go to bed for to-day, anyhow.
Don't you say so, doctor?"</p>

<p>"I do most emphatically," answered the
physician, who had seated himself at the table
and was busied in measuring out medicines;
"and I'm very glad, Miss Damaris, to see you
here."</p>

<p>"It appeared to be my duty to come," she
said, looking not ill-pleased; "I'm no great
nurse, but I can do housework and cook for
sick or well; and them things is as necessary
as the nursing."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Dr. Grange, and went on
to give directions to her concerning the proper
food for his patients, and to Mildred in regard
to the administering of medicines and other
remedies.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>He made his round among them, pronounced
Zillah much better, Mr. Keith slightly so. He
was silent as to the little boys, and Mildred's
heart was full of anguish as she perceived from
his countenance, or thought she did, that their
recovery was still very doubtful.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord had remained at Mr. Keith's bedside
while the doctor and Mildred were absent
from the room, and was still there when they
returned. He looked perplexed and ill at ease.</p>

<p>"I have no skill in nursing," he said;
"never have had any experience; am in fact a
very unsuitable person for the task; being very
absent minded, as you both know. But if I
can be of any service, I&mdash;Miss Mildred, I can
sit here and hand anything he asks for, call you
if he needs your assistance, and give the medicines,
if you will be good enough to remind me
when it is time to do so."</p>

<p>The offer was gladly accepted and the new
nurse entered upon his duties immediately.</p>

<p>Yet even with these new and unexpected
helps it was clearly impossible for the weary
girl to give proper attention to five very sick
persons, and two who were barely convalescent.
Her heart was overwhelmed; the burden
heavier than she could bear.</p>

<p>But blessed be God, the God of Israel, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
people need not bear their griefs and anxieties
alone; he bids them not.</p>

<p>"Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he
shall sustain thee." "Call upon me in the day
of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me."</p>

<p>These and other like great and precious
promises were brought home with power and
sweetness to Mildred's mind in this time of deep
distress and anguish, and kept her from sinking
beneath the load.</p>

<p>"O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that
trusteth in thee." "For thou, Lord, wilt bless
the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass
him as with a shield."</p>

<p>There seemed no earthly friend left to come
to Mildred's aid; she could think of none.
Claudina Chetwood and Lucilla Grange were
both themselves lying upon sick beds; so were
all her lady acquaintances in Pleasant Plains
except such as, like herself, had their hands
more than full with the care of the sick in their
own families; and Aunt Wealthy was so far,
far away that before a message could reach her,
they might all be in their graves.</p>

<p>How long it seemed since she went away!
how long since the beginning of this dreadful
sickly season that had, as it were, shut her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
(Mildred) away from all pleasant social intercourse
with her young companions into her own
little world of trial and trouble!</p>

<p>It was a comfort that some one was attending
to domestic affairs, some one sitting with
her sick father and Rupert, who now shared his
bed; but ah, she could not more than half attend
to the pressing needs of the others.</p>

<p>The day was intensely hot, scarce a breath
of air stirring though every door and window
stood wide open. The little boys feverish and
restless, wanted to be fanned every moment,
and called almost incessantly for "cold fresh
water."</p>

<p>The others craved it, too; and it could be
had only from the spring at the foot of the
steep river bank. And ice being an unknown
luxury in Pleasant Plains at that period, it could
not be kept cool for any length of time.</p>

<p>She did not feel at liberty to call upon either
Miss Drybread or Mr. Lord for this service,
and as the one judged it unnecessary that the
water should be brought frequently and the
other was too absent-minded to think of offering
to bring it, and she could not leave her
charges to go herself, even if her strength had
been equal to the effort in addition to all the
other demands upon it, she could but endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the pain of seeing the loved ones suffer from
thirst.</p>

<p>"Water, water, cold water, Milly," sobbed
little Don.</p>

<p>"This is cold water, dear," she said holding
a cup to his lips.</p>

<p>"No, 'tisn't right cold," he fretted, pushing
it away; "it doesn't taste good. Oh, send somebody
to bring cold, <i>cold</i> water!"</p>

<p>She set down the cup and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Absorbed in her grief and distress, she did
not hear the gate gently opened and shut again,
or a step coming up the path, across the porch,
through the hall and into the room where she
sat weeping such bitter tears as she had never
wept before.</p>

<p>But it was a cautious tread; as of one who
feared to disturb the sick, as was the fact. With
that fear before his eyes Wallace Ormsby had
taken thought even to come in slippered feet.</p>

<p>He should have paused at the room door
till invited to enter, but forgot everything else
at sight of Mildred's distress, and never stopped
till he was close at her side.</p>

<p>"O, Mildred, dear Mildred, what is it? what
can I do to help and comfort you?" he said in
tones tremulous with love and pity, as he bent
over her and took her hand in his.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>She started with surprise, but the hand was
not withdrawn, and the lips and eyes smiled
faintly through the rain of tears as she looked
up into his noble face and read there ardent
affection and deep sympathy in her sorrow.</p>

<p>"Surely you will let me help you in this
dreadful time when there's no more proper person
to do it?" he said with earnest entreaty.
"Why should we care for conventionalities
now? You are weak and worn out, in sore
need of assistance; I am well and strong, able
and more than willing to give it. Say, may I
not stay here by your side and help with this
nursing?"</p>

<p>"Water, cold water!" sobbed Don, "oh, go
get cold water for me and Cyril."</p>

<p>"Yes, Wallace, Mr. Ormsby," Mildred said,
the tears coursing down her cheeks, "I cannot
sacrifice them to conventionalities, and so gladly
accept your kind offer of help."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk! go get water, quick!"
fretted Don, "I can't wait, Milly, what makes
you so naughty to me?"</p>

<p>Wallace seized a pitcher standing near, and
hastened to the spring. He was no stranger to
the premises and knew the way.</p>

<p>For the next fortnight he had what he considered
the blessed privilege of sharing Mildred's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
burdens, griefs and cares; watching with
her over each of those dear ones as they passed
through the crisis of the disease, and the first
stages of the after convalescence; for they all
recovered; a fact which the parents and older
children recognized with deep heart-felt gratitude
to Him to whom "belong the issues from
death."</p>

<p>Nor did they forget the thanks due their
earthly helpers and friends. The minister held
a warmer place than before in the hearts of
these parishioners, and Damaris Drybread received
a substantial reward for her services;
which, as she was dependent upon her own exertions
for a livelihood, was not declined.</p>

<p>That fearful sickly season passed away; but
not soon to be forgotten by the survivors, and
comparative health and prosperity again dawned
upon the town and surrounding country.</p>

<p>The Keiths returned to their old busy cheerful
life, and Wallace Ormsby, beloved by the
whole family, seemed as one of them. Years
of ordinary social intercourse could not have
brought him into so close an intimacy with
them, and especially with Mildred, as those two
weeks in which they two shared the toils, the
cares and anxieties of those who watch by beds
of sickness that may end in death.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>They had learned to know each other's
faults and weaknesses, strong points and virtues,
and with the knowledge their mutual esteem
and admiration had but increased; they had
been warm friends before, now they were&mdash;not
plighted lovers, Ormsby had not spoken
yet&mdash;but</p>
